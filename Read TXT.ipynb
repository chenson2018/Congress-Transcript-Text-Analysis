Yesterday, what I urged my \\ncolleagues—since so many of us ran on \\na reform agenda and since so many of \\nus have talked about the need to make \\nthis process more accountable, open, \\nand honest—I asked my colleagues \\nreally, under the leadership of Senator \\nLEVIN, to vote on an amendment which \\nwould say that we would put an end to \\nthis taking of gifts. The vote was ‘‘no.’’ \\n\\nSo today, focusing on the same ques-\\ntion, I am going to, in this amendment, \\nessentially say to my colleagues if you \\nare going to vote ‘‘no’’ against the tak-\\ning of gifts, the gift ban part, at least \\nlet us put a stop to this, I think, insid-\\nious connection between the lobbying \\nand the taking of cash and campaign \\ncontributions. \\n\\nSo this amendment is going to pro-\\nhibit lobbyists who may lobby within \\nthe preceding year from making con-\\ntributions to or soliciting contribu-\\ntions for Members of Congress and \\nfrom lobbying Members of Congress to \\nwhom they have contributed or on \\nwhose behalf they have solicited funds \\nwithin the previous year. \\n\\nIn other words, if you have made a \\ncontribution or you have instructed a \\nPAC you control to make a contribu-\\ntion to a candidate, then for 1 year \\nthereafter you should not be lobbying \\nthat candidate or staff. Vice versa, if \\nyou have been in that office lobbying a \\nSenator or lobbying staff, then there is \\na 1-year window here whereby you \\nwould not be allowed to make a cam-\\npaign contribution. \\n\\nThis amendment is all about congres-\\nsional accountability. Let me repeat \\nthat. This amendment is all about con-\\ngressional accountability. And it is de-\\nsigned to sever the connection between \\nlobbyists and big PAC contributions to \\nMembers of Congress. \\n\\nThis covers congressional staff, and \\nit would prohibit lobbyists from lob-\\nbying new Members of Congress to \\nwhom they have contributed or on \\nwhose behalf they have solicited funds \\nduring the past year which I think, \\nfrom the point of view of the new class, \\nalso represents real reform. \\n\\nMr. President, this amendment was \\npart of S. 3, which the Senate passed by \\na very lopsided vote. Senators then \\nsaid that they thought this was an im-\\nportant reform idea, or I should say an \\nimportant reform measure. It would \\nprohibit the practice whereby a lob-\\nbyist who lobbies a Member for a client \\nthen directs that client to make a con-\\ntribution to the Member. It closes the \\npotential loophole allowing lobbyists \\nto get around the prohibition by hav-\\ning clients make contributions to \\nMembers to further their lobbying ef-\\nforts. \\n\\nIn other words, it is not just a ques-\\ntion of lobbyists not being able to do \\n\\nit, but it is also a question of a lobbyist \\nnot being able to instruct a client to \\nmake such a contribution. \\n\\nThis amendment will also prohibit a \\nlobbyist from directing that a con-\\ntribution be made by a political action \\ncommittee to a Member of Congress \\nwhom that lobbyist has lobbied during \\nthe past year, a key element of any re-\\nform effort designed to sever—let me \\nemphasize that—the connection, big \\nmoney connection, between large lob-\\nbying firms, their clients, and PAC’s. \\n\\nMr. President, one more time, we \\nhave before us the Congressional Ac-\\ncountability Act. We are talking about \\nhow to make this process more ac-\\ncountable. Reform is in the air in \\nAmerica. We started out this session \\non the basis of a focus on reform, and \\nthis particular amendment speaks to \\nthat question. \\n\\nYesterday, I urged my colleagues to \\nvote for an amendment that I thought \\nwas a huge step forward—not a small \\nstep forward, but a huge step forward— \\nin changing the political culture of \\nWashington in putting a stop to taking \\nthese gifts. Many Senators, though I \\nam proud to say by no means all Sen-\\nators, but certainly many Senators, \\nand on the other side of the aisle, all \\nSenators on the other side of the \\naisle—I guess there were two excep-\\ntions—voted ‘‘no.’’ With this amend-\\nment, I am saying if you are not will-\\ning to put an end to the accepting of \\ngifts, at least put an end to this insid-\\nious connection between lobbying and \\nthe giving of money. \\n\\nIf there is one thing we have heard \\nfrom people in the country, it is that \\nthey do not like this mix of money and \\npolitics. They do not like the fact that \\nsome people march on Washington \\nevery day. They do not like the fact \\nthat this is such a closed loop in which \\nthey do not feel as if they participate. \\nAnd I cannot think of an amendment \\nthat would speak more clearly and \\nmore directly to people’s concerns than \\nthis amendment. \\n\\nMr. President, this provision, when \\nthis amendment was first brought up \\nfor S. 3—which again I remind my col-\\nleagues was passed by an overwhelm-\\ningly positive vote—was crafted nar-\\nrowly to withstand the test of con-\\nstitutionality. The Court has said that \\nany seeming infringement on first \\namendment speech rights has to be bal-\\nanced against concerns about corrup-\\ntion or the appearance of corruption. \\nThat is what we are talking about \\nhere, the appearance of corruption. If \\nyou run for office and you are elected, \\nlobbyists come in and lobby you, and \\nthen later there is a contribution. Or, \\nvice versa, you receive a contribution \\nand lobbyists instruct a PAC or client \\nto make a contribution to you, and \\nthen shortly thereafter the lobbyist is \\nin your office. \\n\\nIf you want to talk about the appear-\\nance of corruption and if you want to \\ntalk about a way of making this proc-\\ness more accountable and you want to \\ntalk about a way that Senators can \\n\\nlive up to our mandate to be reformers, \\nthis amendment speaks directly to this \\nquestion. \\n\\nMr. President, again, this amend-\\nment meets that test. It is directed \\nnarrowly at the question of the appear-\\nance of corruption or impropriety. Let \\nme emphasis that again. It is directed \\nnarrowly at the question of the appear-\\nance of corruption or impropriety. And \\nit covers only those situations where a \\nlobbyist has made a lobbying contact \\nand then contributes, solicits on behalf \\nof, or directs that a contribution be \\nmade to a Member. \\n\\nIt attempts to define who is a lob-\\nbyist. By the way, so no mistake will \\nbe made, we simply go by the current \\ndefinition. We get into none of the de-\\nbate and argument on the reform of \\nlobby disclosure. We just go with the \\ncurrent definition which—and by the \\nway, I think all of us agree, if our \\nwords are to be believed—eventually \\nhas to be changed. There are many who \\nlobby who are not officially registered \\nas lobbyists today. \\n\\nMr. President, I also want to include \\nin the RECORD a letter from the White \\nHouse, January 5, 1995, which was ad-\\ndressed to the Speaker, in which the \\nfocus is on congressional reform, with \\na strong focus on this whole question \\nof lobbying reform. \\n\\nI ask unanimous consent that this \\nletter be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\nThere being no objection, the letter \\nwas ordered to be printed in the \\nRECORD, as follows: \\n\\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \\nWashington, January 5, 1995. \\n\\nHon. NEWT GINGRICH, \\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Wash-\\n\\nington, DC. \\nDEAR MR. SPEAKER: We have an oppor-\\n\\ntunity to make historic change in the way \\nthat Washington works and the government \\ndoes the people’s business. \\n\\nThis week, the Congress has begun to take \\nimportant and positive steps to change its \\noperations for the better. Shrinking the \\nnumber of committees, reducing staff, and \\nother measures are valuable, and long over-\\ndue. The passage of legislation that would \\napply to Congress the laws that apply to the \\npublic is only fair, is simple common sense, \\nand is also long overdue. I hope that this \\ntime, unlike the last session of Congress, the \\nSenate follows the House’s action. I con-\\ngratulate you on these steps. \\n\\nBut true congressional reform must reduce \\nthe power of lobbyists and special interests. \\nThe power of organized money in Wash-\\nington hurts the middle class, bloats spend-\\ning and the deficit, and blocks needed \\nchange. Today, some 90,000 people in Wash-\\nington are associated with lobbying Congress \\non behalf of specific interests, which too \\noften are able to manipulate the congres-\\nsional process to insert spending projects or \\ntax provisions in legislation that do not \\nserve the larger public’s interest. Lobby \\npower coupled with the ever-escalating cost \\nof campaigns, which has risen fourfold over \\nthe past two decades, gives wealthy interests \\nand wealthy candidates disproportionate in-\\nfluence in decisionmaking. \\n\\nThese are not partisan concerns; they are \\nAmerican concerns. I urge you, as you under-\\ntake the task of reforming Congress, to take \\non these real political reform issues. \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S531 January 6, 1995 \\nFirst, as you enact legislation to apply \\n\\ngeneral laws to Congress, it is vital that pro-\\nfessional lobbyists be barred from giving \\ngifts, meals and entertainment to members \\nof Congress—just as they are now barred \\nfrom giving these benefits to executive \\nbranch officials. \\n\\nSecond, Congress should also quickly enact \\nlegislation to bring professional lobbyists \\ninto the sunlight of public scrutiny. The cur-\\nrent lobby disclosure statute is cumbersome \\nand antiquated. Lobbyists should disclose \\nwho their clients are, what bills they seek to \\npass or block, and how much they are paid. \\n\\nThird, I am pleased that the Congress \\nwants to pass a line item veto authority for \\nthe President, something that I have consist-\\nently supported before and during the 1992 \\ncampaign and since. The line item veto au-\\nthority will help us cut unnecessary spend-\\ning and reduce the budget deficit. It is a pow-\\nerful tool for fighting special interests, who \\ntoo often are able to win approval of waste-\\nful projects through manipulation of the \\ncongressional process, and bury them in \\nmassive bills where they are protected from \\nPresidential vetoes. It will increase the ac-\\ncountability of government. I want a strong \\nversion of the line item veto, one that en-\\nables the President to take direct steps to \\ncurb wasteful spending. This is clearly an \\narea where both parties can come together in \\nthe national interest, and I look forward to \\nworking with the Congress to quickly enact \\nthis measure. \\n\\nFinally, we must clean up political cam-\\npaigns, limit the cost of campaigning, reduce \\nthe role of special interests, and increase the \\nrole of ordinary citizens. Real campaign fi-\\nnance reform, too, should be an area of bi-\\npartisan cooperation. Requiring broadcasters \\nto provide time to bona fide candidates \\nwould cut the cost of campaigning and en-\\nsure that voters hear all arguments, regard-\\nless of candidate wealth. Strong proposals \\nfor free TV time have been introduced in pre-\\nvious years by Senator Dole and by the new \\nchair of the House Commerce Committee, \\nRep. Thomas Bliley; these proposals should \\nbe the basis of agreement on reform. \\n\\nI look forward to working with the Con-\\ngress to achieve results that are bipartisan, \\nbold, and give the government back to the \\npeople. \\n\\nSincerely, \\nBILL CLINTON. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let \\nme just summarize for my colleagues, \\nbecause I think that we will be casting \\nan important vote on this amendment, \\nI think it is an important vote because \\nthis is sort of a litmus test as to how \\ncommitted we are to reform. \\n\\nI cite this as a relevant document: \\nRoll Call, Monday, October 17, where \\nthe whole focus is on meals and travel \\nand campaign contributions, as ways of \\nhaving access for clients. Mr. Presi-\\ndent, if you want to talk about a memo \\nthat tells it all, if you want to talk \\nabout a memo that, unfortunately, sort \\nof speaks to the very concerns that \\npeople have about this process, this is \\nan example. \\n\\nI ask unanimous consent that this \\nRoll Call piece be printed in the \\nRECORD. \\n\\nThere being no objection, the mate-\\nrial was ordered to be printed in the \\nRECORD, as follows: \\n\\n[From Roll Call, Oct. 17, 1994] \\n\\nHOW LOBBYISTS PUT MEALS, GIFTS TO WORK \\n\\n(By Timothy J. Burger) \\n\\nDuring the protracted debate over new lob-\\nbying and gift rules—which went down to \\nstunning defeat in the waning days of the \\nsecond session—Members argued violently \\nover the influence of lobbyist-paid meals and \\ncampaign contributions. \\n\\n‘‘Now, a Big Mac will not buy influence \\nfrom anybody. I am sure $15,000 will not buy \\ninfluence from anybody,’’ Rep. Dan Burton \\n(R-Ind) said on the floor. \\n\\nMocked retiring House Minority Leader \\nBob Michel (R-Ill): ‘‘Here we are today de-\\nmeaning ourselves by saying. ‘Oh, please \\nstop me before I accept another cup of coffee \\nand a Danish.’’’ \\n\\nDespite such protestations, meals and con-\\ntributions are fixtures in the lobbying \\nworld—and internal documents from a \\nprominent Washington lobbying firm dem-\\nonstrate just how central they are to con-\\nducting business. \\n\\nIn December 1993, principals of Gold and \\nLiebengood assembled plans for expanding \\ntheir network of Hill contacts for 1994. \\n\\nThe planning documents, copies of which \\nwere obtained by Roll Call, offer a rare \\nglimpse into the world of lobbying and, spe-\\ncifically, how meals, gifts, and contributions \\nare put to use. \\n\\nTake, for instance, the strategy for James \\nCapel and Co. Ltd., a British securities firm, \\nthat is a longtime client of Gold and \\nLiebengood. \\n\\nAccording to the memo: ‘‘Capel is desirous \\nof dinners, lunches, and meetings for them-\\nselves and their clients, with a diverse list of \\nMembers of Congress Capel has agreed to pay \\nG&L a separate fee for each and every one of \\nthese Congressional visits we arrange. \\n\\nPotential targets: John Dingell, Jack \\nBrooks, Norman Mineta, and Al Swift, were \\nthe initial Members mentioned. Capel would \\nbe receptive to suggestions from us.’’ \\n\\nThe 12-page memo was drafted by Charles \\nMerin, a Gold and Liebengood partner, and \\nJohn Scruggs, the firm’s managing director \\nand a former aide to then-Rep. Trent Lott \\n(R-Miss). It includes specific agencies for \\neach of the principals. \\n\\nAmong Scruggs’s ‘‘targets’’ were Reps. \\nPorter Goss (R-Fla) and Pat Danner (D-Mo). \\n\\n‘‘Congresswoman Danner defeated Tom \\nColeman. Coleman was a strong and con-\\nsistent supporter of Wilcox. Need to develop \\nsimilar relationship with Danner,’’ the \\nmemo noted. ‘‘Action: Continue to work \\nwith staff (hesitancy to accept gifts). Ask \\nChuck Merin for introduction followed by \\nfundraising activity.’’ \\n\\nWilcox, a manufacturing company, is a \\nformer Gold and Leibengood client. \\n\\nRegarding Goss, the outline noted: ‘‘Porter \\nGoss became a member of the Rules Com-\\nmittee early in this Congress. Only Minority \\nMember on the committee with whom I do \\nnot have an established relationship. \\n\\n‘‘Action: Seek opportunity for campaign \\ncontribution, followed by goodwill develop-\\nment.’’ \\n\\nIt appears, however, that Gold and \\nLiebengood did not follow through on all of \\nits plans. Goss and Danner told Roll Call \\nthey never heard from Scruggs. \\n\\nAmong the ‘‘targets’’ outlined for Merin \\nwere Alan Roth, staff director of the House \\nEnergy and Commerce Committee—‘‘Mul-\\ntiple client interests before the Committee \\nwould be enhanced by a better working rela-\\ntionship with him’’—and Democratic Reps. \\nBobby Rush (Ill), Scotty Baesler (Ky), and \\nBobby Scott (Va). \\n\\nThe Merin outline describes the Congress-\\nmen as ‘‘Promising Freshman Members with \\n\\nwhom I need to firm up an existing, but cas-\\nual relationship. \\n\\n‘‘Action: Arrange sit-downs/meals with \\nthese Members and mutual Member friends. \\n\\n‘‘Ask Jack Clough, former E&C Committee \\ntop aide, to arrange a lunch.’’ \\n\\nMerin said he never followed through with \\nRoth, Baesler, or Scott and that he become \\nacquainted with Rush through meetings, not \\nmeals, with the Congressman. \\n\\nScruggs, Merin, and a founding partner, \\nformer Senate Sergeant at Arms Howard \\nLiebengood, last week were shown copies of \\nthe documents obtained by Roll Call. \\n\\nIn a letter of response, Scruggs wrote: \\n‘‘The documents are not newsworthy in any \\nrespect and were intended solely for private \\nnot public consumption. The activities sug-\\ngested in the documents are neither unique \\nnor inappropriate in any manner. As this \\nfirm is bipartisan and has no Political Ac-\\ntion Committee, all members are encouraged \\nto participate in political development-indi-\\nvidually and they do.’’ \\n\\nGold and Liebengood is in the final year of \\na five-year buyout and will be wholly owned \\nby Burson-Marsteller at the end of 1994. \\n\\nThe memo also documents the firm’s in-\\nvolvement in leadership races. \\n\\nWritten some 11 months ago, the Gold and \\nLiebengood ‘‘Campaign Activity Outline’’ \\ndiscussed Merin’s plans to work on the year’s \\nmost dramatic long-shot leadership race: \\n‘‘Charlie Rose for Speaker.’’ \\n\\nMerin’s plans were to ‘‘Continue working \\nwith Rose and his campaign deputies to \\nbroaden the network of Member commit-\\nments.’’ \\n\\nThis type of activity is ‘‘always a game of \\nRussian roulette,’’ said Howard Marlowe of \\nthe lobbying firm, Marlowe & Co., who \\nserved as president of the American League \\nof Lobbyists from 1988 to 1990 and is a mem-\\nber of the organization’s board. \\n\\n‘‘As long as you back the winner, then \\nyou’ve made the right choice,’’ said Marlowe. \\n‘‘[And] in this case, the loser is somebody \\nwho’s still around and so whatever you did to \\nhelp him or her out is probably going to be \\nremembered. So I think that probably rep-\\nresents a smart political move on their \\npart.’’ \\n\\nBut, Marlowe said, ‘‘I think in general lob-\\nbyist ought to probably try to refrain from \\ngetting involved in the internal leadership of \\nthe House or Senate.’’ \\n\\nSaid Merin of his involvement in the lead-\\nership race: ‘‘The election of a Speaker of \\nthe House, much like the appointment of any \\nMember to any committee, is a matter ex-\\nclusively and totally within the purview of \\nthe institution. The ability of any outsider \\nto leverage the process to his or her advan-\\ntage is virtually nil. The only real role any \\noutside can play in the process is to provide \\nlimited advice and counsel.’’ \\n\\nSaid Rose: ‘‘I don’t see Chuck Merin much \\nmore than I see other lobbyists that visit \\nme. But be’s a friend. * * * He has been help-\\ning me [with] new candidates and [to] raise \\nmoney from some of his clients. * * * Some \\nof the people he represents have given money \\nto my leadership PAC. * * * He’s told them \\nthat I have a good chance to be Speaker.’’ \\n\\nRose noted that ‘‘since the beginning of \\nCongress, [lobbying firms] have helped peo-\\nple become Speaker and Majority Leader and \\nget elected to Congress. The vote for leader-\\nship around here comes from the Democratic \\nCaucus.

Newt Gingrich (Ga) will leave \\nwhen he’s elected Republican Leader in De-\\ncember. \\n\\nScruggs, the memo states, is ‘‘Serving on \\nadvisory group of lobbyists supporting Walk-\\ner Whip campaign.’’ It cites a ‘‘Commitment \\nto do ‘meet and greets’ for GOP candidates \\nidentified by Walker as he campaigns for po-\\ntential GOP freshmen in next year’s Con-\\ngressional races.’’ \\n\\nSaid Walker in an interview, ‘‘This is a guy \\nwho is a personal friend of mine of 20 years \\nstanding. * * * It’s not being done as a lob-\\nbyist. It’s being done as a personal friend.’’ \\nWalker said Scruggs ‘‘consults with me from \\ntime to time * * * and has put together some \\nmeet and greets.’’ Walker said Scruggs is \\nonly one of many lobbyists working on his \\nbehalf. \\n\\nGold and Liebengood does not have a PAC \\nand does not as a firm formally back specific \\ncandidates, although its 13 individual lobby-\\nists are encouraged to follow their own polit-\\nical development agendas. This sometimes \\nleads Gold and Liebengood lobbyists to sup-\\nport opposing candidates for the same office. \\n\\nUnderscoring this point, Scruggs said in \\nthe interview that ‘‘Gold and Liebengood is \\nnot working for Charlie Rose for Speaker. \\nBecause I’m the managing director and I’m \\nsupporting Newt Gingrich for Speaker and I \\nthink that sort of sums it up.’’ \\n\\nSaid Ellen Miller, executive director of the \\nCenter for Responsive Politics: ‘‘We always \\nexpect this happens. But you know that level \\nof involvement in leadership races is pretty \\nstartling. It’s another chapter in the book \\n‘How Washington Really Works’. * * * I’m \\nafraid it’s not unique at all.’’ \\n\\n‘‘Do I know we get targeted? Sure,’’ said \\nGoss. As a public official, ‘‘You give up some \\nprivacy and you just expect people are trying \\nto figure out ways to get access to get their \\nviews across.’’ \\n\\nOther political development projects listed \\nfor Merin: \\n\\n‘‘Mel Watts [sic] for a Rules Committee \\nseat. The Congressional Black Caucus will be \\nable to recommend a successor to [A]lan \\nWheat on the Rules Committee. Mel is the \\nCBC Chairman’s choice for that vacancy. As-\\nsist Mel in building a network of non-CBC \\nSteering and Policy Committee Members \\nwho will support his appointment.’’ \\n\\nWatt said this month he has no knowledge \\nof the memo or Merin’s interest in winning \\nhim a spot on the Rules panel. \\n\\n‘‘Al Wynn for an Energy and Commerce \\nCommittee Seat.

Mr. President, to \\nsummarize, this amendment is de-\\nsigned to prohibit lobbyists from mak-\\ning contributions to, or soliciting con-\\ntributions for Members of Congress \\nwhom they have lobbied within the \\npreceding year, and from lobbying \\nMembers of Congress to whom they \\nhave contributed or on whose behalf \\nthey have solicited funds within the \\nprevious year. \\n\\nIf you have gone in—this includes \\nstaff as well—if you have gone in to see \\none of the Senators as a lobbyist or \\ngone in to lobby with staff, then for 1 \\nyear—that is what we are talking \\nabout—you are not allowed to make \\ncampaign contributions. If you have \\ncontributed to a Senator, then within a \\n1-year period of time, you are prohib-\\nited from lobbying the Senator or staff. \\n\\nThis is all about making this process \\nmore open. This is all about reform. \\nThis is all about making sure we have \\na system in our country of democracy \\nfor the many and not democracy for \\nthe few. This is all about congressional \\naccountability. And yesterday, too \\nmany of my colleagues—as it did not \\nget a majority vote—voted against end-\\ning this practice of receiving the gifts, \\nthe argument being we will get to it \\nlater. By the way, since I have been \\nhere in the Senate, I have heard that \\nargument over and over and over \\nagain. I think we will get to it later \\nthis term. I know I will bring this up \\nover and over and over again until we \\ndo get to it. \\n\\nToday I say this to my colleagues: If \\nyou are not going to agree with the \\nproposition that we should put an end \\nto the taking of these gifts now, then \\nat least agree to the proposition—if we \\nare talking about congressional ac-\\ncountability—that we ought not to be \\ntaking this money from lobbyists. At \\nleast agree there ought to be a 1-year \\nperiod of time between the lobbying ac-\\ntivity and the giving of money. Does it \\nnot seem as if this is reasonable? Does \\nit not seem as if this is a prudent \\ncourse? Does it not seem that if we are \\ntalking about reform, we ought to vote \\nfor this? We cannot separate the legis-\\nlative lives we live and how we vote \\nfrom the words we speak. \\n\\nAMENDMENT NO. 5 \\n\\n(Purpose: To restrict political contributions \\nby lobbyists) \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I, \\nin a short period of time, have to get \\nready for a call-in that I do back with \\nMinnesotans. So not seeing anybody, I \\nam wondering whether colleagues are \\ninterested in debating this. If not, I \\nwill ask unanimous consent that this \\n\\namendment, for the moment, be set \\naside. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, re-\\nserving the right to object. What was \\nthe specific point that the Senator \\nfrom Minnesota requested? \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I \\nasked unanimous consent that if there \\nwas no further debate at the moment, \\nthat my amendment be temporarily set \\naside. I have another engagement, but \\nI will be back at 11 and ready to de-\\nbate. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. I think some debate \\nmay proceed on your amendment while \\nyou are gone because people on our side \\nof the aisle want to speak on that. So \\nI would like to keep his amendment be-\\nfore the body. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I \\nsay to my colleague from Iowa that \\nthat course is very reasonable, as long \\nas I would have time to respond. I will \\nbe back here at 11. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Obviously, we will \\nbe able to do that since there is no \\ntime agreement. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the re-\\nquest withdrawn? \\n\\nMr. GLENN. Reserving the right to \\nobject, and I will not, just to clarify \\nthis, if there is not sufficient opposi-\\ntion on this side to take up the time, if \\nanother amendment was brought to the \\nfloor before Senator WELLSTONE comes \\nback, I presume it would be OK if we \\nset it aside and went on with the other \\namendment. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I \\nwould be agreeable to either propo-\\nsition. If Senators want to debate \\nthis—and certainly there should be de-\\nbate on this amendment, as that is \\nwhat we are all about, and it is an im-\\nportant debate—I would be pleased to \\nhave this amendment out on the floor. \\nI will be back at 11 and I will be pleased \\nto respond. If other Senators come \\nwith amendments and there are not \\nSenators speaking directly to this \\namendment, I would be pleased to have \\nthis amendment set aside. \\n\\nMr. GLENN. I will not object. \\nMr. WELLSTONE. I do withdraw my \\n\\ninitial unanimous-consent request. \\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the \\n\\nsituation this morning, Friday morn-\\ning, is that we are on S. 2. This is a bill \\nthat we Republicans, the new majority, \\npromised that we would give early con-\\nsideration to, and hopefully pass early \\non to get the bill to the President for \\nsignature. \\n\\nThe House of Representatives, in \\ntheir first day of session, unanimously, \\non a rollcall vote, passed this piece of \\nlegislation. This legislation provides \\nthat the exemptions that Congress as \\nan institution and individual Members \\nof Congress have had as employers \\nfrom certain employment and safety \\nlaws, in some instances for over 60 \\nyears, will no longer be in place. \\n\\nThe purpose of this legislation is to \\nend the environment in this country \\nwhere we have two sets of laws—one \\nfor Capitol Hill and the one for every-\\nbody else, everywhere else in the coun-\\ntry. \\n\\nIt will end a situation where there is \\none set of laws for Pennsylvania Ave-\\nnue and another set of laws for Main \\nStreet, U.S.A. It will end the situation \\nwhere employees of Congress do not \\nhave the same employment and safety \\nrights and access to the courts for the \\nenforcement of those rights that pri-\\nvate sector employees have. \\n\\nFor a long period of time people, in \\nthe private sector, both employees and \\nemployers, but particularly employers, \\nhave resented a legal situation in this \\ncountry where laws passed for the safe-\\nty and the employment rights of indi-\\nvidual private-sector employees of this \\ncountry, have been in place for one set \\nof employees but not for another. The \\nburden of regulation on the private- \\nsector employer has been in place, but \\nthat burden of regulation has not been \\nin place for Capitol Hill. And, of \\ncourse, that resentment has mounted, \\nand mounted, and mounted over sev-\\neral years now that this has become an \\nissue. \\n\\nIt was No. 1 on the list of promises \\nthat the new majority made to the \\nAmerican people that we would pass. \\nConsequently, that is why it did pass \\nthe House of Representatives and that \\nis consequently why our distinguished \\nmajority leader, Senator DOLE, made a \\npromise to make that the first bill for \\nconsideration of this body. \\n\\nSo we had a full day’s debate on this \\nbill yesterday and we are probably \\ngoing to have a full day’s debate today \\nand into next week. But I notice from \\nthe debate yesterday and the debate so \\nfar today, it is not on the substance of \\nthe legislation: ending the situation \\nwhere we have one set of laws for Con-\\ngress and another set of laws for the \\nrest of the country. \\n\\nI am glad to know that there is that \\nfair amount of unanimity, maybe a \\ngreat deal of consensus, at least, on the \\nissue of the legislation. But debate yes-\\nterday was on the issue of lobbying and \\non the issue of gifts—very legitimate \\nissues to be discussed before this \\nbody—and now this morning we are \\nstarting debate on unrelated legisla-\\ntion dealing with lobbying; again, a \\nvery legitimate subject for the Senator \\nfrom Minnesota to bring to this floor. \\n\\nBut is it legitimate at this time to \\nbring it before this body? Well, of \\ncourse, under the rules, it is. But does \\nit fit in with the goals that people de-\\nsired for this Congress early on when \\nthey made the decision in the last elec-\\ntion to send a new majority to the \\nHouse and Senate and to the House for \\nthe first time in 40 years? I think not, \\nparticularly in light of the fact that \\nthe distinguished majority leader, Sen-\\nator DOLE, has promised that all of \\nthese issues will have time for discus-\\nsion on the floor of this body very \\nearly in this session, probably within \\nthe next 2, 3, 4 months, at the latest. \\n\\nSo I beg the Senator from Minnesota \\nand the Senators from other States \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES534 January 6, 1995 \\nthat have other amendments not ger-\\nmane to the specific purpose of S. 2 to \\nwait for the appropriate time so that \\nwe do not frustrate the will of the peo-\\nple expressed in the last election, and \\nthat we move forward with ending this \\nspecial treatment of Capitol Hill to be \\nexempted from 11 major pieces of legis-\\nlation. Let us move on with this bill, \\nget it to the President for signature— \\nthe President wants to sign it—and \\nthen take up the usual course of busi-\\nness and abide with faith in the prom-\\nise of the distinguished majority leader \\nthat these issues will be brought up \\nand bring them up at that appropriate \\ntime. We should not try to wreck a \\nvery good piece of legislation that \\npassed the House unanimously and I \\nwill bet will almost pass this body \\nunanimously as well. \\n\\nI yield the floor and urge Senators on \\nmy side who want to debate Senator \\nWELLSTONE’s amendment to please \\ncome over here and do that, because we \\nwill not have rollcalls as long as there \\nis a leadership meeting down at the \\nWhite House. \\n\\nMr. GLENN addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Ohio. \\nMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not \\n\\nhave a dog in this fight. I do not have \\nan amendment that I am proposing \\nhere, but I cannot help but respond to \\nthe remarks of my distinguished col-\\nleague from Iowa. I will be very brief \\nbecause I know Senator SIMON would \\nlike to make a statement here on the \\nfloor and I am happy to see him do \\nthat. \\n\\nBut this idea that somehow because \\nthere is a push on for something here \\nthat we can avoid having anyone put \\non amendments is wishful thinking. I \\nneed only go back in my mind’s eye \\nand remember what was happening \\nabout 60 days ago or 90 days ago here \\non floor when anything we put forth \\nwas subject to amendments, extra-\\nneous or not. It was delay for delay’s \\nsake and it was a scorched earth pol-\\nicy. \\n\\nTo say that we should let some piece \\nof legislation, as much as I want it— \\nand I am as big a backer on this piece \\nof legislation on congressional ac-\\ncountability one could possibly be, but \\nit is entirely within the right of any \\nSenator who wants to offer an amend-\\nment. Although I do not have an \\namendment to offer, I do not want to \\nlet anything go by that would be crit-\\nical of people who do have amendments \\nto offer and are offering them in all \\ngood sincerity. They think it is right. \\nIf they want to attach it on by the \\nrules of the Senate, we, obviously, can \\ndo that. \\n\\nWe had talk here yesterday about we \\nshould be giving the new majority a \\nchance to govern. Well, we do not set \\naside all the Senate rules in giving \\nanybody a chance to lead or a chance \\nto govern. I am all for leadership hav-\\ning all the leadership prerogatives, but \\nthose prerogatives do not mean that we \\nare able to set aside amendments that \\n\\npeople may, in all sincerity, propose, \\nwhether I agree with them or not. \\n\\nI yield the floor. \\nMr. SIMON addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Illinois. \\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask \\n\\nunanimous consent to address the Sen-\\nate for 5 minutes as if in morning busi-\\nness. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nf \\n\\nTHE STRIKE AT BRIDGESTONE/ \\nFIRESTONE \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, on July \\n12, of last year, 4,200 members of the \\nUnited Rubber Workers went on strike \\nat Bridgestone/Firestone. The plants \\nare in Decatur, IL; Des Moines, IA; \\nOklahoma City; Akron, OH; and \\nNoblesville, IN. Negotiations had been \\ngoing on for some time prior to that on \\nthe new contract. The United Rubber \\nWorkers had insisted on a similar con-\\ntract to the contract they had with \\nGoodyear. Bridgestone/Firestone, \\nwhich is wholly owned by a Japanese \\ncompany, insisted they could not do \\nthat, and then negotiations broke off. \\n\\nThe distinguished Senator from Ohio, \\nas well as some of our colleagues, met \\nwith the Japanese Ambassador and \\nurged that they renew negotiations. \\nUnfortunately, the situation has dete-\\nriorated so that Bridgestone/Firestone \\nhas said they are going to permanently \\nreplace all these workers. \\n\\nIt is the first time in modern history \\nthat that has been done in a large \\nscale, with the exception of the PATCO \\nstrike. And there, frankly, you had \\npeople who were breaking the Federal \\nlaw, and President Reagan—and I \\nthink it could have been handled bet-\\nter—but President Reagan made the \\nproper decision that you cannot violate \\nthe Federal law and he replaced the \\nworkers. This is an unusual situation. \\nIt is contrary to the traditions of \\nlabor-management relations in our \\ncountry. Interestingly, it would be ille-\\ngal in Japan. \\n\\nNow, we have a situation where 2,000 \\nor more workers are going to be perma-\\nnently replaced. It is not going to be \\ngood for labor-management relations \\nin those communities. It is not going \\nto be good for United States-Japanese \\nrelations. It is just a bad situation all \\nthe way around. My hope is that we \\ncan urge our friends in Japan and urge \\nthe leaders of this company to recog-\\nnize this is not wise. \\n\\nShort-term may save a few bucks. I \\ndo not know any of the details of the \\nnegotiations. But I have been involved \\nin labor-management negotiations \\noften enough that I know if you sit \\naround a table and try and work things \\nout, generally you can work out a prac-\\ntical compromise. I urge they do that. \\nThat they not go ahead as they are now \\nplanning. \\n\\nI will, later today, be contacting \\nsome of our colleagues in the affected \\nStates with a resolution that they may \\n\\nwant to cosponsor, urging that they \\nget back to the negotiating table and \\nnot have this permanent striker re-\\nplacement. It is interesting that of the \\nmodern nations only Great Britain, \\nSingapore, and Hong Kong permit per-\\nmanent striker placement, plus the \\nUnited States. But we have a tradition \\nof not doing it. That tradition is occa-\\nsionally violated by a very small com-\\npany, but rarely by any company this \\nlarge. \\n\\nI hope we can have some common \\nsense by the leaders of this industry. I \\nhope the leaders of this industry and \\nthe United Rubber Workers can get to-\\ngether. I urge them not to proceed with \\nthe permanent replacement of these \\nworkers. \\n\\nI yield the floor, Mr. President. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Tennessee. \\nMr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I \\n\\nsuggest the absence of a quorum. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\n\\nClerk will call the roll. The assistant \\nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the \\nroll. \\n\\nMr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, I \\n\\nwant to ask my good friend from Min-\\nnesota if he was or had ever been a \\nmember of the American Civil Lib-\\nerties Union? \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I \\ndo not think that I am now. I make a \\nlot of contributions to a lot of organi-\\nzations and I cannot tell the gentleman \\nfor sure. If I had been a member, I \\nwould have been proud to do so. How-\\never, I cannot answer for sure because \\nI cannot remember our previous \\nrecords. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I thank my friend \\nfrom Minnesota. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased \\nto call my wife, Sheila, and we will go \\nover our records and be pleased to an-\\nnounce when we made a contribution, \\nif we did. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I am sure my \\nfriend from Minnesota agrees with the \\nSenator from Kentucky that the Amer-\\nican Civil Liberties Union on many oc-\\ncasions has done fine work. Much of it \\nI find myself in disagreement with. \\nThere have been those times, I think, \\nclearly proving the objectivity of the \\nACLU when I find myself allied with \\nthem. The American Civil Liberties \\nUnion as earlier testified on the pro-\\nposal that the Senator from Minnesota \\nhas offered, because it was as he indi-\\ncated, a part of S. 3, an unfortunate \\nmeasure that the Senate mercifully \\nput to rest last year through some ef-\\nfort. The occupant of the chair partici-\\npated in this effort, as well as the Sen-\\nator from Kentucky, regarding the \\nrights of people to participate in the \\npolitical process. \\n\\nNow, what the Senator from Min-\\nnesota has done is craft a measure \\nwhich I am certain would be quite pop-\\nular with the people of the United \\nStates since they have become con-\\nvinced that lobbyists are odious folks \\nwho are up here buying influence and \\nsubverting the political process. Un-\\nless, of course, the lobbyists happens to \\nbe working for a cause they believe in, \\nin which case they think the lobbyist \\nis doing great work for America. \\n\\nRegardless, this notion that this par-\\nticular segment of our society should \\nbe singled out for unconstitutional \\ntreatment, it seems to me, is com-\\npletely absurd. Maybe what we ought \\nto do is introduce an amendment say-\\ning trial lawyers cannot contribute to \\na campaign, or maybe labor unions \\ncannot contribute to campaign. How \\nabout bad lobbyists cannot contribute \\nto campaigns? Surely there are good \\nlobbyists and bad lobbyists. Maybe we \\nwould pick out the bad lobbyists and \\nthey cannot contribute. \\n\\nWell, Mr. President, you get my drift. \\nThe Constitution clearly does not \\nallow us to single out certain kinds of \\nAmericans because of their professions \\nand take away their constitutional \\nrights. It is simply impermissible. It \\nmight be popular. \\n\\nSomebody told me, and I did not see \\nthe survey, somebody told me that in \\nrecent years many Americans indi-\\n\\ncated they do not support the Bill of \\nRights. I do not know whether that is \\ntrue or not. Apparently some pollster \\nasked a series of questions based upon \\nthe Bill of Rights and apparently many \\npeople did not support those items. \\n\\nIt would not surprise me that the \\namendment as crafted by the Senator \\nfrom Minnesota would probably make \\nfor a terrific campaign commercial but \\nthe point is it trashes the Constitution. \\nIt absolutely trashes the Constitution. \\nIt is not even in the gray area. \\n\\nMr. President, I would like to take a \\nmoment to read from the testimony of \\nthe American Civil Liberties Union be-\\nfore the Senate Rules Committee, May \\n19, 1993, on this point, in testifying on \\nthe issue of prohibiting contributions \\nfrom lobbyists. And the testimony \\nsaid: ‘‘Another clearly unconstitu-\\ntional provision in the President’s pro-\\nposal’’—this was in President Clinton’s \\ncampaigning finance bill—‘‘is the ban \\non political contributions by registered \\nlobbyists (or alternatively, the ban on \\nlobbying by political contributors). \\nLobbying is both the essence of polit-\\nical speech and association and is spe-\\ncifically protected under the first \\namendment as the right of the people \\n‘to petition the Government for a re-\\ndress of grievances.’ The various ex-\\npressive rights encompassed by that \\nnotion are considered indivisible. After \\nall, the first amendment ‘was fashioned \\nto assure the unfettered interchange of \\nideas for the bringing about of legal \\nand social change as desired by the \\npeople’. Lobbying is nothing more than \\na manifestation of this interchange,’’ \\nsaid the ACLU, ‘‘because lobbying is \\ndesigned to influence public policy, the \\nspeech that is burdened by this pro-\\nposal is ‘at the heart of the first \\namendment’s protections’.’’ Quoting \\nthe case of First National Bank of Bos-\\nton versus Bellotti in 1978 and con-\\nstitutes ‘‘the essence of self-govern-\\nment,’’ and CBS versus FCC, Garrison \\nversus Louisiana. \\n\\n‘‘Moreover,’’ the testimony said, ‘‘it \\nis wholly at odds with the guarantees \\nof the first amendment to place legisla-\\ntive restrictions on those engaged in \\n’the discussion of political policy gen-\\nerally or advocacy of passage of defeat \\nof legislation’.’’ \\n\\n‘‘The Court’s decision’’, the ACLU \\nwent on, ‘‘make apparent that these \\nactivities involve the highest level of \\nconstitutional protection.’’ \\n\\nThe highest level of constitutional \\nprotection, Mr. President. We are not \\ntalking about an issue that is in the \\ngray area. This is not a close call, Mr. \\nPresident. The highest level of con-\\nstitutional protection. \\n\\nThe ACLU went on, \\nLike other provisions in the proposal, the \\n\\nban on making political contributions is an \\nunconstitutional condition imposed because \\nof the exercise of a constitutional right. It \\ndoes not matter that it is primarily aimed at \\nthose who represented moneyed interests, \\nbecause the provision will not affect those \\ninterests—only their registered lobbying rep-\\nresentative. \\n\\nThus, it is both ineffective in accom-\\nplishing that goal and in preventing the ap-\\n\\npearance of corruption. Because the bill al-\\nready establishes contribution limits in \\norder to cabin the potential for corruption, \\nthat potential has been removed from the \\nfield of contention. There are no legitimate \\ngrounds—— \\n\\nI repeat, Mr. President, no legitimate \\ngrounds— \\n\\nto believe that a lobbyist restricted to the \\nsame maximum contributions will have any \\nmore undue influence over a legislator’s \\nviews than anyone else. Thus, the specially \\nrestrictive treatment of lobbyists can only \\nbe viewed as a penalty for their frequent and \\nsustained exercise of their constitutional \\nright to address public policy issues before \\nthe political branches of Government. \\n\\nThis is it, Mr. President. And I see \\nmy friend from Indiana is here. I am \\nabout to wrap it up. \\n\\nThe Constitution simply does not tolerate \\nthat result. \\n\\nThe Constitution does not tolerate \\nthat result. \\n\\nMr. President, I would like to ask \\nunanimous consent—— \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, \\nwill the Senator yield for some ques-\\ntions? \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. Just for a second. \\nI would like to ask unanimous con-\\n\\nsent, Mr. President, that a letter dated \\ntoday from the American Civil Lib-\\nerties Union legislative counsel, Robert \\nS. Peck, on the amendment before us, \\nappear in the RECORD at this point. \\n\\nThere being no objection, the letter \\nwas ordered to be printed in the \\nRECORD, as follows: \\n\\nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, \\nWashington, DC, January 6, 1995. \\n\\nHon. MITCH MCCONNELL, \\nU.S. Senate, \\nWashington, DC. \\n\\nDEAR SENATOR MCCONNELL: This morning, \\nSenator Wellstone proposed an amendment \\nto S. 2 that would prohibit political con-\\ntributions to federal officeholders by reg-\\nistered lobbyists. The American Civil Lib-\\nerties Union opposed the amendment as in-\\nconsistent with the guarantees of the First \\nAmendment. \\n\\nThe amendment would prohibit lobbyists \\nfrom making political contributions during a \\nperiod of one year following a lobbying con-\\ntact. Alternatively, if a lobbyist does make a \\npolitical contribution, the lobbyist would be \\nprohibited from making a lobbying that \\nmember of Congress or covered executive \\nbranch officers for a one-year period fol-\\nlowing the contact. Finally, it prohibits lob-\\nbyists from suggesting to clients possible re-\\ncipients of their campaign contributions. \\n\\nThe First Amendment provides, among \\nother things, broad guarantees of freedom of \\nspeech and the right to petition the govern-\\nment for redress of grievances. The Supreme \\nCourt, in the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 \\nU.S. 1 (1976), held that campaign contribu-\\ntions are a form of free speech that is pro-\\ntected under the Constitution. The Buckley \\nCourt approved of a system of campaign con-\\ntributions limitations that were designed to \\navoid the appearance of corruption as the \\nleast restrictive means of furthering an im-\\nportant governmental interest without un-\\nduly obviating a constitutional right. Be-\\ncause these contribution limits still stand, \\nfurther restrictions on contribution rights, \\nsuch as the limitation on contributions by \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES536 January 6, 1995 \\nlobbyists, do not meet the constitutional re-\\nquirements of the least-restrictive-means \\ntest. \\n\\nMoreover, the First Amendment also the \\nright to lobby, denominated in the Constitu-\\ntion as the right ‘‘to petition.’’ As the Court \\nsaid in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484 \\n(1957), the First Amendment ‘‘was fashioned \\nto assure the unfettered interchange of ideas \\nfor the bringing about of political and social \\nchanges desired by the people.’’ Lobbying is \\nnothing more than a manifestation of this \\ninterchange. Because lobbying is designed to \\ninfluence public policy, the speech that is \\nburdened by this proposal is ‘‘at the heart of \\nthe First Amendment’s protection,’’ First Na-\\ntional Bank of Boston v. Belloti, 435 U.S. 765, \\n776 (1978), and constitutes ‘‘the essence of \\nself-government.’’ CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 US. \\n367, 396 (1981) (quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, \\n379 U.S. 64, 75 (1964)). Moreover, it is ‘‘ ‘whol-\\nly at odds with the guarantees of the First \\nAmendment’ ’’ to place legislative restric-\\ntions on those engaged in ‘‘ ‘the discussion of \\npolitical policy generally or advocacy of pas-\\nsage or defeat of legislation.’ ’’ Meyer v. \\nGrant, 486 U.S. 414, 428 (1988) (quoting Buck-\\nley, 424 U.S. at 50, 48 (1976)). The court’s deci-\\nsion make apparent that these activities in-\\nvolve the highest level of constitutional pro-\\ntection. \\n\\nThe ban on making political contributions \\nproposed by this amendment is an unconsti-\\ntutional condition imposed because of the \\nexercise of a constitutional right. It does not \\nmatter that it is primarily aimed at those \\nwho represent moneyed interests, because \\nthe provision will not affect those interests— \\nonly their registered lobbying representa-\\ntive. Thus, it is both ineffective in accom-\\nplishing that goal and in preventing the ap-\\npearance of corruption. The existence of con-\\ntribution limitations already cabins the po-\\ntential for corruption. Thus, there are no le-\\ngitimate grounds to believe that a lobbyist \\nrestricted to the same maximum contribu-\\ntions will have any more undue influence \\nover a legislator’s views than anyone else. \\n\\nThe ACLU urges the Senate to reject this \\namendment, as unconstitutional and ill-con-\\nceived. \\n\\nSincerely, \\nROBERT S. PECK, \\n\\nLegislative Counsel. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Actually, Mr. \\nPresident, instead, the Senator from \\nIndiana wants to speak to the same \\namendment. I wondered whether I \\ncould just respond for a moment first \\nto the Senator from Kentucky, if the \\nSenator from Indiana will give me that \\ncourtesy. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the \\nSenator from Minnesota objecting to \\nthe request of the Senator from Ken-\\ntucky? \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. No. \\nMr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I \\n\\nbelieve I have floor. I do not want to \\nunduly detain the Senator from Indi-\\nana. I want to wrap it up. \\n\\nMr. COATS. Mr. President, if I may \\ninquire of the Chair of the procedure \\nhere, it is my understanding that we \\nwill move to procedure under the unan-\\nimous-consent agreement. If that is the \\ncase, I will not be able to give my \\nstatement and I can give it later. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. If the Senator will \\nyield. \\n\\nMr. COATS. I will be happy to yield \\nto the Senator. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I believe the vote \\nwill be at a quarter to 12. I will be \\nthrough in a minute. \\n\\nMr. COATS. I thank the Senator. \\nMr. MCCONNELL. I yield to the Sen-\\n\\nator from Minnesota. \\nMr. WELLSTONE. Instead of asking \\n\\na question, I wonder if I may have \\nsome time to respond. Then, of course, \\nthe Senator from Kentucky—— \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. Why not have the \\nSenator from Minnesota and myself \\nsimply enter into a colloquy and ad-\\ndress the Chair? \\n\\nMr. President, I see the Senator from \\nMinnesota is in the Chamber. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, the colloquy is in order. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I am pleased to do \\nso. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I \\nhave enjoyed having colloquies and dis-\\ncussion with the Senator from Ken-\\ntucky in the past and always respect \\nwhat he has to say. \\n\\nLet me start out by saying that I just \\nbet there is one thing the Senator from \\nKentucky and I will agree on, and what \\nwe will agree on is that the American \\nCivil Liberties Union is not always \\nright. Does the Senator from Kentucky \\nagree with me on that? \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I certainly agree \\nwith the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \\nPresident, that the ACLU is not always \\nright. However, it certainly has been \\non the campaign finance issues, and I \\nthink they have been a lot right on \\nconstitutional questions. \\n\\nThis is an organization, Mr. Presi-\\ndent, we all know exists to help Ameri-\\ncans enforce first amendment rights. \\nAnd what the Senator from Minnesota \\nis seeking to do here today is to set \\naside a type of American citizen and \\nsay that because you earn your income \\nin this particular way, you do not have \\nthe constitutional rights that every-\\nbody else in America has. The ACLU \\nsaid this is constitutionally impermis-\\nsible. I hope that will be persuasive to \\nmy colleagues, and that is the reason I \\nraised the point. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the \\nreason I make this point is the Amer-\\nican Civil Liberties Union is not al-\\nways right, and I think all of my col-\\nleagues understand that. I do not think \\nthey are right on this issue. I do not \\nthink the American Civil Liberties \\nUnion was right on the lobbying disclo-\\nsure. They take a certain position. I \\nthink my colleagues know, including, \\nMr. President, my colleague from Ken-\\ntucky, that my record, my passion \\nabout the importance of first amend-\\nment rights is clear, very clear. But \\nthe American Civil Liberties Union is \\nsimply wrong again. \\n\\nMr. President, what the Supreme \\nCourt has said in Bellotti is that any \\nsignificant infringement on first \\namendment speech rights has to be bal-\\nanced against concerns about corrup-\\ntion or appearance of corruption. \\n\\nMr. President, understand what this \\nis all about, this is trying to break this \\nvery clear nexus—— \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. Will the Senator \\nyield for a question? \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. In just a moment. \\nI would like to finish my analysis, if I \\nmay. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I thought we were \\nin a colloquy here, and I would like the \\nSenator to respond to a question, if he \\ncan. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. We are in a col-\\nloquy, but I think the Senator will be \\nbetter able to ask me a question if I \\ncan just finish my point. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. All right. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. So, Mr. President, \\nthe point is that we are talking about \\na very clear nexus here between lob-\\nbying and the giving of money. Just so \\nmy colleagues understand, this amend-\\nment is designed to prohibit lobbyists \\nfrom making contributions to or solic-\\niting contributions for Members of \\nCongress whom they have lobbied with-\\nin the preceding year—1 year, that is \\nwhat we are talking about—and from \\nlobbying Members of Congress to whom \\nthey have contributed or on whose be-\\nhalf they have solicited funds within \\nthe previous year. \\n\\nNow, Mr. President, this amendment \\nwas part of S. 3, which passed by a fair-\\nly significant margin in the Senate. \\n\\nAt the very end of the last session, \\nwe had a filibuster which prevented the \\ncampaign finance reform bill from \\ngoing to conference committee, as I re-\\nmember. But many Senators voted for \\nthis amendment. It was in the bill. And \\nonce again, Mr. President, I am just \\nsimply responding to the bill before us. \\nI am trying to improve this bill. It is \\ncalled congressional accountability. \\n\\nYesterday, Senators said they would \\nnot vote for the proposition that we \\nshould not take the gifts. Today, I am \\nsaying should we not at least go on \\nrecord, if we are interested in a more \\naccountable process, that we do not \\ntake these contributions within this 1- \\nyear period of time? I think this is, of \\ncourse, open to a challenge, a constitu-\\ntional challenge, as is much of the leg-\\nislation that we pass. But with all due \\nrespect—I am not a lawyer, Mr. Presi-\\ndent, but I can just tell you that there \\nare two sides to this question. The fact \\nthat the ACLU does not agree with this \\namendment does not mean, therefore, \\nthat this amendment, ipso facto, \\nshould be declared unconstitutional by \\nmy colleagues. That is simply not the \\ncase. I think it will withstand the scru-\\ntiny of the courts. \\n\\nIn any case, the real issue here is \\nabout reform, is about the influence of \\nlobbyists, is about making sure that we \\nmake this process more accountable, \\nand it is about breaking this connec-\\ntion between money and lobbying and \\nat least having this 1-year window. \\nThat is what this is about. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL addressed the \\nChair. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Kentucky. \\n\\nThe Chair indicates that the Senator \\nfrom Kentucky, under the previous \\norder, is recognized until 11:25, and the \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S537 January 6, 1995 \\nSenator from Minnesota is to be recog-\\nnized from 11:25 to 11:45. You, by unani-\\nmous consent, are engaging in a col-\\nloquy, so it is your time. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I \\nam just going to reclaim the floor very \\nbriefly, and then I am going to yield \\nthe remainder of my time to the Sen-\\nator from Indiana. \\n\\nThe Senator from Minnesota cites no \\ncases—because there are none—for the \\nproposition that he suggests. I cited \\nfour or five. This is not in the gray \\narea. This is clearly unconstitutional. \\nThe Senator argues that because of the \\nperception problem, the rights of lob-\\nbyists should be taken away. My guess \\nis there may be a perception that labor \\nunions contribute to campaigns, too. \\nMaybe we should take their rights \\naway. Or others may think we ought \\nnot to have trial lawyers contribute to \\npolitical campaigns and maybe we \\nshould take their rights away. \\n\\nThe Constitution does not make it \\npossible to pick on people by taking \\nrights away in legislation. This is not a \\nclose call, Mr. President. This is clear-\\nly, blatantly unconstitutional. \\n\\nMr. President, what time do I have \\nremaining? \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\nChair indicates the Senator from Ken-\\ntucky has 6 minutes and 20 seconds re-\\nmaining. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I yield all of my \\ntime to the Senator from Indiana. \\n\\nMr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank \\nthe Senator for yielding. I do want to \\nstate I came to the floor to make a \\nstatement on the underlying bill and \\nnot on this particular amendment. If it \\nwould be more appropriate to make \\nthat statement at a different time, I \\nwill be happy to do that. The Senator \\nmay want to address the specifics of \\nthis amendment before he yields the \\ntime. \\n\\nMr. MCCONNELL. I say to the Sen-\\nator from Indiana, I have said all I \\nwant to say about this and I am happy \\nto yield the remainder of my time. \\n\\nMr. COATS. I thank the Senator. \\nMr. President, 200 years ago, our \\n\\nFounding Fathers fought a revolution \\nagainst what they saw as an imperial \\ngovernment, a government that taxed \\nthem to the point of despair and denied \\ntheir freedom. From this revolution, \\nthey built a country on the idea that \\nthe preservation of the freedom and the \\nintegrity of the common man was the \\nmeasure of good government. \\n\\nLast year, on the 8th day of Novem-\\nber, the American people rebelled once \\nagain, this time not against an impe-\\nrial government but against an impe-\\nrial Congress. They fought this revolu-\\ntion with the legacy of our Founding \\nFathers. They fought it with their \\nvote. \\n\\nThe American people voted in No-\\nvember to overthrow an entrenched, \\ndistant Congress. They forcefully dem-\\nonstrated that they were very deeply \\ncynical about their Government and \\ndeeply skeptical about its ability to \\ncreate sound public policy. They de-\\n\\ncided that an institution which could \\nnot govern itself could not govern the \\nrest of us. \\n\\nIt was a sobering decision because it \\nis impossible to be simultaneously held \\nin contempt by the American public \\nand to be viewed as an institution ca-\\npable of providing leadership on the \\nmajor problems facing our Nation. \\n\\nAnd so the simple conclusion and the \\nsimple fact is this. We must restore the \\nfaith of the American people in their \\nelected representatives if major prob-\\nlems are to be effectively addressed \\nand endorsed and embraced by the \\nAmerican people. We need to create an \\nenvironment in this body where we can \\nfocus on important problems. That is \\nthe mandate of the election and that \\nrequires major reform in the way that \\nthis institution conducts its business. \\n\\nFour years ago I stood before this \\nbody to introduce four measures de-\\nsigned to rein in an out-of-touch Con-\\ngress. These measures ensured that \\nthere would be an end to the midnight \\npay raises slipped in in the back rooms \\nto an otherwise popular bill, hoping to \\nslip it by the process that would expose \\nit to debate and allow Members to vote \\nup or down and have their constituents \\nknow what their vote was. I am pleased \\nthat this measure has now been adopt-\\ned into law and is part of the Constitu-\\ntion of the United States so that no \\nlonger will we be allowed to raise or \\nadjust our pay without exposing it to \\nthe light of debate and putting our \\nyeas and nays in public for the public \\nto judge us on. \\n\\nI introduced a measure to reform the \\nway in which we judge each other and \\nI introduced a measure that would re-\\nturn this body from one of a profes-\\nsional body to a citizen legislature, \\nwhich I believe our Founding Fathers \\nintended. \\n\\nFinally, I introduced a measure guar-\\nanteeing that the Congress would live \\nunder the same laws it passes for ev-\\neryone else. Significantly, we are here \\ntoday debating that fourth measure. It \\nis the worst, most obvious hypocrisy, \\nfor the Senate to pass legislation that \\napplies to every other American except \\nfor those who wrote the legislation. It \\nsets the Congress apart as a privileged \\nelite, unbound by normal rules and \\nstandards. And it protects the Congress \\nfrom the consequences of its own fail-\\nures and excessive burdens. This meas-\\nure, this one that we are debating \\ntoday and will vote on—this measure \\nensures that public laws would be ap-\\nplied to public servants. Anything less \\nis a dangerous double standard. \\n\\nFrom the Clean Air Act, which I sup-\\nported, to the Americans With Disabil-\\nities Act, to OSHA regulations, to \\nlabor standards, to civil rights laws, \\nCongress will be forced to come into \\ncompliance with the very laws that \\nCongress has passed and imposed on \\nthe citizens Congress was elected to \\nserve. Knowing that Congress must \\ncomply with laws that it considers, \\nhopefully we will write better laws or \\nperhaps maybe no law at all. I fully ex-\\n\\npect that we will be overwhelmed and \\nin many cases simply unable to comply \\nwith the laws already on the books. \\nThe basement of the Capitol alone will \\nbe enough to employ a team of OSHA \\ninspectors in perpetuity. Yet, if it is \\nimpossible for us to comply, perhaps \\nwe will finally understand the extent of \\nthe burden which we have placed on \\nAmerican citizens. Our citizens and \\nfamilies, small businesses, the lifeblood \\nof jobs in America, are suffering under \\nthe weight of unprecedented Govern-\\nment intrusion into the very way they \\nlive their lives and do their work. The \\npremise is simple enough. We will \\nwrite better laws if we are forced to \\nlive under those laws. If it is impos-\\nsible to comply with the law, we should \\nnot write it. \\n\\nWith a vote earned by the sacrifice of \\nso many Americans, the American peo-\\nple have staged a second American rev-\\nolution. The Congressional Account-\\nability Act is the first measure in ful-\\nfilling the promise of that revolution \\nfor future generations of Americans. \\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The time \\n\\nof the Senator from Indiana has ex-\\npired. Under the previous order, the \\nSenator from Minnesota is recognized \\nfor up to 20 minutes. \\n\\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, \\nfirst of all, let me be very clear. I said \\nthis yesterday and I want to say it \\nagain to my colleagues, I am very sup-\\nportive of this Congressional Account-\\nability Act. I think this piece of legis-\\nlation should and must be passed. That \\nis why I did not want this to be open- \\nended. I wanted this debate to be with-\\nin a reasonable period of time. \\n\\nBut if we are going to say that we are \\ntrying to make the Congress—the Sen-\\nate accountable, we can do much bet-\\nter. There is no reason why we cannot \\nstrengthen this piece of legislation. We \\ndo that all the time on the floor of the \\nSenate. That is the very essence of our \\naccountability. Senators come out \\nwith amendments to strengthen a piece \\nof legislation and we vote on those \\namendments up or down and then we \\nare held accountable for our votes. \\n\\nThis amendment was part of a cam-\\npaign finance reform bill which was \\npassed June 17, 1993, I guess at 2:11 p.m. \\nThis was the vote: 60 yeas, 38 nays. \\nThis amendment was part of this piece \\nof legislation that was passed by many \\nSenators who now still serve in this \\nbody.

I am \\ntalking about the appearance of cor-\\nruption. What this amendment says— \\nand I went over it very carefully this \\nmorning—is that if a lobbyist comes \\ninto your office to see you or staff, \\nthen at least a year ought to go by be-\\nfore that lobbyist contributes money \\nto you or instructs a client to do so. Or \\nif a lobbyist, or a client instructed by \\na lobbyist, a PAC instructed by a lob-\\nbyist, contributes money to you in \\nyour race—I say that to those Senators \\nwho have just come to the Senate—a \\nyear ought to go by before that lob-\\nbyist is allowed to come in and lobby \\nyou. \\n\\nWe voted for this before. There was \\nstrong support for it before. We are \\ntalking about congressional account-\\nability. If my colleagues think they \\ncan hide behind a smokescreen argu-\\nment—you know, different Senators \\nhave different views about how to in-\\nterpret legislation. Of course someone \\ncan stand up and say the ACLU says it \\nis not constitutional, therefore it is \\nnot constitutional. Many of us voted \\nfor it before. And I would think that \\nmany of my colleagues who ran on a \\nreform agenda, who said they were in-\\nterested in reform, would vote for it \\nnow. I do not think we should trivialize \\nthis issue. We are focusing on congres-\\nsional accountability. We are focusing \\nspecifically on an essential problem \\nwith the way Government operates. \\n\\nI have heard a lot about the way Gov-\\nernment operates. If we want the Gov-\\nernment to operate in such a way that \\nthe citizens we represent back in our \\nStates feel that Government is open \\nand accountable and responsive to \\nthem, and not just those folks who \\nmarch on Washington every day—that \\nis to say who are here every day, well \\nheeled, well oiled, well financed, with \\nlobbyists, having way too much access \\nand say—then certainly we can break \\nthis link. \\n\\nThis is an extremely modest amend-\\nment. I am astounded, frankly, that \\nthere is any real opposition to it. I \\nreally am. \\n\\nMr. President, yesterday I came out \\non the floor with Senator LEVIN, Sen-\\nator FEINGOLD, and Senator LAUTEN-\\nBERG. And we said at the very begin-\\nning of the session, let us send a strong \\nmessage to the people we represent. As \\nlong as we are talking about congres-\\nsional accountability, let us pass an \\namendment that focuses on prohibiting \\nthe taking of these gifts, trips to the \\nBahamas or Hawaii paid for by whom-\\never; meals, tickets, you name it; not \\nbecause we think that Senators or Rep-\\nresentatives are corrupt—we do not be-\\nlieve that, we are proud of being in the \\nSenate—but because we know that the \\npeople we represent—I have heard this \\nstandard over and over again; I have \\n\\nheard Senators announce this standard \\non the floor—we know that the people \\nwe represent do not receive those gifts \\nand it is inappropriate. It is really un-\\nacceptable. Let it go. \\n\\nYesterday the vote was against that \\namendment. Really the only argument \\nI heard was the control argument. We \\nare in control. We are in control here, \\nand therefore there are not going to be \\nany amendments on this bill. It was \\nnot the merit of the amendment. It did \\nnot have anything to do with at the be-\\nginning of the session making it clear \\nto people we were for reform. It was \\ncontrol. Well, Senators did not vote for \\nthat. \\n\\nToday I have an amendment that \\nsays at the very minimum, if we are \\ngoing to talk about reform and ac-\\ncountability, I urge my colleagues to \\nvote for this amendment. I think it \\nsends a very positive signal to the peo-\\nple we represent, which is we are not \\ngoing to take one thing while we cam-\\npaign, and then vote against it on the \\nfloor of the Senate. We are not going to \\nhide behind the ACLU. We vote it up or \\ndown. We are not going to hide behind \\na control issue. Our party is in power; \\ntherefore, we are not accepting any \\namendments. I have even heard some of \\nmy colleagues say—I think, I do not \\nhave the particular day or time—that \\ncampaign finance reform is off the \\nagenda this Congress. Mr. President, it \\nis not off the agenda. The reason it is \\nnot off the agenda is that each and \\nevery Senator has a right to come to \\nthe floor with amendments that focus \\nin on what a Senator believes are im-\\nportant issues to the people he or she \\nrepresents. \\n\\nI happen to believe that for Minneso-\\ntans this is an extremely important \\nissue. By the way, not that polls al-\\nways make the difference. I actually \\nhope they do not because I hope every \\nSenator votes his or her conscience \\nwhen that is the case. But if you were \\nto do a poll in the cafes of Minnesota \\nas to whether or not we ought to vote \\nfor an amendment to put an end to this \\nsort of insidious connection between \\nthe lobbying and the giving and the \\ntaking of money with at least a not \\noutright prohibition but at least a 1- \\nyear moratorium, 99.9999 percent of the \\npeople in Minnesota would agree. What \\nis the hesitation? Why would my col-\\nleagues be opposed to it? \\n\\nMr. President, I had actually looked \\nforward to more debate on this. So far \\nwe have heard about the American \\nCivil Liberties Union’s position and \\nthat is it. So I have to assume that is \\nthe reason my colleagues are going to \\nvote against this, if they are going to \\nvote against this. I have not heard an-\\nother Senator come to the floor with \\nany other substantive reason given for \\nvoting against this amendment. \\n\\nI can tell you, Mr. President, in the \\nspirit of accountability—and we are \\ntalking a congressional accountability \\nact—I would think Senators would be \\nclear as to why they are opposed. I \\nhave not heard that. And in the ab-\\n\\nsence of hearing that opposition, \\nthough one Senator, Mr. President, the \\nSenator from Kentucky certainly \\nspoke against it, I look forward to this \\nvote and I believe that this amendment \\nshould be passed by the Senate. And \\ncertainly as to those Senators who \\nvoted for this campaign finance reform \\nbill, which included this amendment \\nbefore, I look forward to their support \\nand the support of some of my col-\\nleagues who are new to this Senate \\nwhom I know are very strong reform-\\ners. \\n\\nMr. President, I conclude my re-\\nmarks and yield the rest of my time. I \\nthink we are going to have a motion to \\ntable at 1:45. \\n\\nSo I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\n\\nclerk will call the roll. \\nThe assistant legislative clerk pro-\\n\\nceeded to call the roll. \\nMr. WELLSTONE.

I thank the Chair. \\nMr. President, before the vote on this \\n\\namendment I just would like to be very \\ndirect with my colleagues. This amend-\\nment speaks to a very real problem. \\n\\nMr. President, this amendment is not \\nan abstract amendment. It does speak \\nto a very real problem. We are talking \\nabout part of the political culture in \\nWashington. Let me lay it on the line \\nat the very end, because that is what \\nthis amendment is about. I will just \\nlay it on the line. It is not uncommon \\nfor a Senator to be lobbied by a reg-\\nistered lobbyist and a month later to \\nget a $5,000 PAC check. It happens. \\n\\nLet me just be very blunt and direct \\nat the very end of this debate.

Let us get away \\nfrom all of the abstract arguments. \\n\\nThe fact of the matter is, Mr. Presi-\\ndent, that all too often lobbyists come \\nin to see a Senator, and shortly there-\\nafter the money flows in. All too often, \\nlobby money flows into campaigns, and \\nshortly thereafter lobbyists and groups \\nand organizations represented by lob-\\nbyists appear. That is egregious. That \\ndoes not give people confidence in this \\nprocess. That does not make the Con-\\ngress very accountable to the many. \\nThat is what this amendment is all \\nabout. \\n\\nMr. President, I simply say to my \\ncolleagues that if you are serious about \\nreform, then this amendment is a test \\ncase of that commitment to reform. I \\ndo not know how any of us can go back \\nto any of the cafes or restaurants in \\nour own States and justify to people \\nhow we voted for the continuation of \\nthis practice. We ought to end it. It is \\na good Government reform. It is part of \\ncongressional accountability, and I \\nurge my colleagues—urge my col-\\nleagues—to support this amendment. \\nThey have in the past. Many of my col-\\nleagues found this to be a compelling \\nproblem and issue in the past. It is just \\nas compelling today. \\n\\nI yield the remainder of my time. \\nMr. President, I suggest the absence \\n\\nof a quorum. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\n\\nclerk will call the roll. \\nThe legislative clerk proceeded to \\n\\ncall the roll. \\nMr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unan-\\n\\nimous consent that the order for the \\nquorum call be rescinded. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nMr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I \\nsupport campaign finance reform legis-\\nlation and I have cosponsored it repeat-\\nedly over the years only to have it fili-\\nbustered or vetoed by the other party. \\n\\nFor me, taken outside the context of \\ncampaign finance reform, this amend-\\nment is problematic. It would prohibit \\na Senator from receiving support from \\nlobbyists but it would not prevent a \\nchallenger from receiving contribu-\\ntions from those very same lobbyists. \\nYet that challenger could be an incum-\\nbent—a Governor, a State legislator, a \\nmayor—and not be subject to the same \\nrestrictions. In my most recent cam-\\npaign, I was challenged by the speaker \\nof the house in the New Jersey State \\nLegislature. I can tell you that he had \\nthe ability, based on his contact with \\nvarious groups and issues, to raise a lot \\nof money from lobbyists and special in-\\nterest groups. So, without a com-\\nprehensive campaign finance program \\nin place, the prohibition in this amend-\\nment singles out incumbent Senators— \\nnot all incumbents—unfairly. \\n\\nFurther, comprehensive campaign fi-\\nnance reform set a limit on the total \\namount of money one could spend on a \\ncampaign. So even if a challenger could \\nreceive funds from lobbyists while an \\nincumbent could not, the limit on total \\nspending would not necessarily create \\n\\nan uneven playing field. In an environ-\\nment of unlimited spending, however, \\ndenying one candidate resources which \\nare available to another is not equi-\\ntable. \\n\\nI support the goal of the Wellstone \\namendment—to break the link between \\ncontributors and any real, or perceived, \\ninfluence on public policy. We can best \\nachieve that goal in the context of \\noverall reform of our campaign finance \\nsystem. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Iowa. \\nMr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, during \\nthe last session of Congress, I was a co-\\nsponsor of the gift ban bill and was \\namong a handful of Republicans who \\nvoted for cloture on the conference re-\\nport. Nevertheless, I voted to table the \\ngift ban amendment to the Congres-\\nsional Accountability Act. \\n\\nCongress has been severely criticized \\nfor passing legislation that applies one \\nset of rules to itself and a separate set \\nof rules to the rest of the Nation. The \\nCongressional Accountability Act \\nchanges that practice, once and for all. \\nThe House already has agreed to simi-\\nlar legislation and is expected to en-\\ndorse the Senate version. Passage of \\nthe gift ban bill would delay final ap-\\nproval of this important measure. \\n\\nFurthermore, passage of a ban on \\ngifts from lobbyists prior to consider-\\nation and passage of strict lobbying \\ndisclosure requirements is, in my view, \\nshortsighted. The majority leader \\nclearly stated his intention to address \\nthe entire issue of how lobbyists inter-\\nact with Members of Congress and \\ntheir staffs. Banning gifts from lobby-\\nists should be addressed in that con-\\ntext. To ban gifts from lobbyists under \\nour present inadequate system of reg-\\nistering lobbyists could act as a dis-\\nincentive to proper registration. \\n\\nMr. GLENN.

Mr. President, I send an \\namendment to the desk and ask for its \\nimmediate consideration. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\nclerk will report the amendment. \\n\\nThe bill clerk read as follows: \\nThe Senator from Nebraska [Mr. EXON] \\n\\nproposes an amendment numbered 6. \\n\\nThe amendment is as follows: \\nAt the appropriate place in the bill, insert \\n\\nthe following: \\nSEC. .—CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A \\n\\nBALANCED BUDGET. \\n(a) PURPOSE.—The Congress declares it es-\\n\\nsential that the Congress— \\n(1) adopt in the first session of the 104th \\n\\nCongress a joint resolution proposing an \\namendment to the Constitution requiring a \\nbalanced Federal budget; \\n\\n(2) set forth with specificity in the first \\nsession of the 104th Congress the policies \\nthat achieving such a balanced Federal budg-\\net would require; and \\n\\n(3) enforce through the congressional budg-\\net process the requirement to achieve a bal-\\nanced Federal budget. \\n\\n(b) POINT OF ORDER AGAINST BUDGET RESO-\\nLUTIONS THAT FAIL TO SET FORTH A GLIDE \\nPATH TO A BALANCED BUDGET.—Section 301 of \\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \\namended by inserting at the end thereof the \\nfollowing new subsection: \\n\\n‘‘(j) CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A \\nBALANCED BUDGET.—It shall not be in order \\nto consider any concurrent resolution on the \\nbudget (or amendment, motion, or con-\\nference report thereon) that— \\n\\n‘‘(A) fails to set forth appropriate levels for \\nall items described in subsection (a)(1) \\nthrough (7) for all fiscal years through 2002; \\n\\n‘‘(B) sets forth a level of outlays for fiscal \\nyear 2002 or any subsequent fiscal year that \\nexceeds the level of revenues for that fiscal \\nyear; or \\n\\n‘‘(C) relies on the assumption of either— \\n‘‘(i) reductions in direct spending, or \\n‘‘(ii) increases in revenues, without includ-\\n\\ning specific reconciliation instructions under \\nsection 310 to carry out those assumptions.’’. \\n\\n(c) REQUIREMENT FOR 60 VOTES TO WAIVE \\nOR APPEAL IN THE SENATE.—Section 904 of \\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \\namended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘301(i),’’ \\nin both places that it appears. \\n\\n(d) SUSPENSION IN THE EVENT OF WAR OR \\nCONGRESSIONALLY DECLARED LOW GROWTH.— \\n\\nSection 258(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and \\nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is \\namended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘sec-\\ntions’’. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest \\nthat the Senate is not in order. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the \\nSenate please come to order and will \\nSenators remove conversations from \\nthe floor. \\n\\nThe Chair recognizes the Senator \\nfrom Nebraska. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, we are \\nhere today considering the worthwhile \\nand laudable goal of applying to the \\nCongress the laws by which all other \\nAmericans live. I wholeheartedly sup-\\nport this endeavor and, I might add, it \\nis long overdue. \\n\\nBut, in all of the discussions, many \\nmay have lost sight of the fact that the \\nsingle most significant law that we are \\ngoing to apply to the American people \\nthis year is an amendment to the Con-\\nstitution to require a balanced Federal \\nbudget. \\n\\nI rise today to offer an amendment \\nthat would apply to the Congress itself \\na constitutional amendment to balance \\nthe Federal budget. Simply put, my \\namendment would create a point of \\norder against considering any budget \\nresolution that fails to comply with \\nthe requirements set out in the bal-\\nanced budget amendment. In other \\nwords, under my amendment, it would \\nbe out of order to consider any resolu-\\ntion that failed to show a balance in \\nthe fiscal year 2002. That is what the \\nbalanced budget amendment requires. \\nNo more and no less. \\n\\nMy amendment will force the Con-\\ngress to live up to the policy statement \\nit will set forth in the balanced budget \\namendment, which I am confident will \\nbe adopted sometime this year. \\n\\nMr. President, I want to put my col-\\nleagues on notice, if anyone is for a \\nbalanced budget amendment to the \\nConstitution—truly for it—he or she \\nshould be for my amendment, too. My \\namendment merely forces Congress to \\nabide by the balanced budget amend-\\nment in its budget resolutions. There \\nare no gray areas in this amendment. \\n\\nSpecifically, my amendment creates \\na point of order against consideration \\nof a budget resolution that would not: \\nFirst, reach a balance in 2002; second, \\nprovide at least the usual budget reso-\\nlution detail; and third, include rec-\\nonciliation instructions to the affected \\ncommittees for all entitlement and tax \\nchanges assumed. \\n\\nMy amendment requires 60 votes to \\nwaive the point of order. This is real \\nenforcement. My amendment applies \\nthe same standards before 2002 that a \\nbalanced budget amendment would \\napply to after the year 2002. \\n\\nMy amendment is also sensible. It \\nprovides that the new point of order, \\njust like other points of order under \\nthe Budget Act, will be suspended if \\nthe Congress declares war or adopts a \\nresolution certifying low economic \\ngrowth, using the existing procedures \\nunder the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \\nmeasure. \\n\\nNow, some might say to me: ‘‘Just \\nwait until the balanced budget amend-\\nment comes up in a couple of weeks.’’ \\n\\nMr. President, with due respect, that \\nis just not good enough. That is not \\ngood enough for the people of the \\nUnited States of America. That is not \\ngood enough for this Senator who has \\ncome to the floor of the Senate year \\nafter year seeking passage of a bal-\\nanced budget amendment, only to come \\naway empty handed. \\n\\nTo uphold our responsibility to the \\nAmerican people on the eve of the near \\ncertain passage of a constitutional \\namendment, we must have the guar-\\nantee before—and I emphasize, Mr. \\nPresident, before—we vote on the bal-\\nanced budget amendment itself that we \\nare going to guarantee the specifics of \\nhow to reach a balanced budget. \\n\\nWithout that, our action would be \\nonly a concept and not a plan. Without \\nthat, our action would be a politically \\npalatable sham. Without that assur-\\nance, we would merely be voting for an \\nidea of a balanced budget, conveniently \\nleaving in the never, never, Alice-in- \\nWonderland future the enforcement \\nmechanisms that are essential to get-\\nting us there. Without that guarantee, \\nwe are adults promising a bridge to \\nfantasyland without pillars or even \\npreliminary plans. \\n\\nSome may say we can only do so \\nmuch deficit reduction at any one \\ntime. To them I say that my amend-\\nment does not force Congress to put all \\nof its deficit reduction in 1 year. Under \\nmy amendment, Congress may even \\nchoose to delay action on deficit reduc-\\ntion into the year 2001 or 2002. But my \\namendment forces Congress to choose. \\nIt must lay out some plan to get us to \\na balance. \\n\\nLet me add, we cannot afford to \\ndelay. Yesterday, the Congressional \\nBudget Office issued a brief prelimi-\\nnary report on the state of the deficit. \\nI had been advised of this previously, \\nand it has come to pass. \\n\\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\\nsent that the full text of that report be \\nprinted in the RECORD at the conclu-\\nsion of my remarks. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\n(See exhibit 1.) \\nMr. EXON. Let me just note a few \\n\\nhighlights that are quite evident from \\nthat report. \\n\\nThe Congressional Budget Office tells \\nus that unless we take action right \\nnow, the deficit will rise to $322 billion \\nin the year 2002. In order to balance the \\nbudget between now and then, the Con-\\ngressional Budget Office tells us that \\nwe will need to achieve some $1.2 tril-\\nlion in deficit reduction, and if we add \\ninto the plan tax cuts in the Repub-\\nlican-controlled Contract With Amer-\\nica and, to a lesser extent, the tax cuts \\nsuggested by the President of the \\nUnited States, that figure will easily \\nexceed $1.5 trillion in cuts that we are \\ngoing to have to make between now \\nand then. \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S541 January 6, 1995 \\nLet us get on with it. To achieve this \\n\\nherculean task, we must begin to act \\nnow. Maybe we are already too late. To \\nquote the CBO report: \\n\\nIf the budget is to be balanced by the year \\n2002, it is vitally important that Congress \\nand the President begin immediately to put \\ninto effect policy that will achieve that goal. \\n\\nThat, Mr. President, is what my \\namendment is all about. My amend-\\nment will force Congress to start deal-\\ning with this challenge now, not in the \\nyear 2002. My colleagues on the other \\nside of the aisle may choose to vote \\nagainst requiring compliance with a \\nbalanced budget, but make no mistake \\nthey will have to vote, they will have \\nto go on record, and if Senators vote \\nagainst my amendment today we will \\nknow that they are in favor of the idea \\nof a balanced budget but they are not \\nfor the reality of a balanced budget \\namendment. \\n\\nMr. President, I believe that this is a \\ncritical time. We are at a juncture \\nwhere we have the responsibility to \\nshow the American people that there is \\nmore to our commitment to balance \\nthe Federal budget than simply words \\nand phrases, and passing the amend-\\nment. \\n\\nI suggest that it is time we showed \\nsome courage, as difficult as that is \\ngoing to be, some responsibility and \\nsome constructive definitive action. \\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \\nEXHIBIT 1 \\n\\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ECONOMIC \\nAND BUDGET OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 1996– \\n2000—A PRELIMINARY REPORT, JANUARY 5, 1995 \\n\\nIn late January, the Congressional Budget \\nOffice (CBO) will publish ‘‘The Economic and \\nBudget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1996–2000.’’ \\nThat volume will provide a detailed analysis \\nof the economic and budget situation facing \\nthe nation. Because the 104th Congress plans \\nto consider economic and budget policies \\nduring January, however, CBO is releasing \\nthis summary of the forecast, estimates, and \\nprojections that will be discussed in the \\nforthcoming report. \\n\\nIn brief, there have been no fundamental \\nchanges in the economic and budget outlook \\nsince CBO’s last baseline revisions were re-\\nleased in August 1994. The economy may be \\na bit more robust in 1995 than was antici-\\npated in August, but a likely slowdown in \\ngrowth in 1996 leaves the current economic \\nprojection for 1999 little different from that \\nwhich was expected in August. \\n\\nSince CBO’s August projections, the short- \\nrun outlook for the deficit has deteriorated \\nmodestly, but the longer-run picture is es-\\nsentially unchanged. Higher-than-antici-\\npated interest payments and lower reve-\\nnues—only partially offset by reduced med-\\nical care costs—have pushed up the deficit \\nprojections for fiscal years 1995 through 1999 \\nby an average of almost $25 billion a year. \\nCBO now projects that the deficit will be $176 \\nbillion in 1995, rising to $207 billion in 1996. \\nCBO’s less detailed longer-term projections \\n(for 2001 through 2005) indicate, however, \\nthat the deficits after 2002 will be somewhat \\nlower than those that CBO projected in Au-\\ngust. \\n\\nThe currently projected deficit for 2002— \\nthe first year that a proposed constitutional \\namendment requiring a balanced budget \\ncould go into effect—is $322 billion. CBO has \\ndevised an illustrative path to a balanced \\nbudget in 2002 that is composed of deficit re-\\nduction totaling $1.2 trillion over the 1996– \\n2002, an amount that would require major \\nchanges in current policies. \\n\\nThe Economic Outlook \\n\\nCBO expects that the strong business in-\\nvestment and personal consumption of dura-\\nble goods that spurred the economy to a 4.0 \\npercent real rate of growth in 1994 will con-\\ntinue into the first part of 1995 (see Table 1). \\nThe 3.1 percent rate of growth forecast for \\n1995 is lower than the rate in 1994 but is \\nslightly higher than that anticipated last \\nAugust. Because CBO estimates that the \\neconomy is already operating close to poten-\\ntial, such growth is expected to result in \\nsomewhat higher inflation and interest \\nrates. In turn, those higher interest rates are \\nlikely to slow growth by the end of the \\nyear—cutting it to 1.8 percent in 1996 but \\ndampening inflationary pressures. In CBO’s \\nlonger-term projections, annual average \\ngrowth is close to the estimated 2.4 percent \\nrate of growth for potential gross domestic \\nproduct (GDP), inflation averages 3.4 per-\\ncent, and interest rates are lower than in \\n1995 and 1996. \\n\\nThe Budget Outlook \\n\\nCBO projects that the deficit will decline \\nfrom the $203 billion registered in 1994 to $176 \\nbillion in 1995, or 2.5 percent of GDP (see \\nTable 2). The deficit’s decline in 1995 is not \\nas great as anticipated last August when \\nCBO projected a deficit of $162 billion for \\nthat year (see Table 3). Very little of the re-\\nestimate for 1995 or other years is the result \\nof legislation adopted since the last baseline. \\nInstead, higher interest rates have increased \\nprojected federal interest costs, and lower \\nwage and salary income has led to slightly \\nlower revenue estimates. Changes in projec-\\ntions that cannot be attributed to legislation \\nor to changes in the economic forecast are \\ncalled technical reestimates. One such re-\\nestimate is a reduction in projected revenues \\nto reflect slightly lower-than-expected tax \\ncollections in 1994. In addition, the costs of \\nMedicare and Medicaid have been reesti-\\nmated downward since August to reflect \\nlower-than-expected spending for Medicaid \\nin 1994 and the slowdown that is occurring in \\nthe growth of health care cost. \\n\\nDeficits are expected to rise after 1995—to \\n$421 billion in 2005, or 3.6 percent of GDP (for \\nprojections of revenues, outlays, and deficits \\nfor 1995 through 2005, see Table 4). Those pro-\\njections assume that current policies gov-\\nerning taxes and mandatory spending remain \\nunchanged. They also assume that discre-\\ntionary spending is consistent with the stat-\\nutory limits on appropriations (both for gen-\\neral purpose spending and for spending from \\nthe Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund) \\nthat are in effect through 1998, and that dis-\\ncretionary spending grows at the rate of in-\\nflation after that. See Table 5 for a compari-\\nson of that baseline with one constructed \\nusing identical assumptions, except that \\nafter 1998 discretionary spending is frozen at \\nthe dollar level of the 1998 cap. Table 6 shows \\nthe projected outlays for the major compo-\\nnents of mandatory spending, which are the \\nsame in both baselines. \\n\\nIllustrative Path to a Balanced Budget \\n\\nA constitutional amendment requiring a \\nbalanced budget will be considered during \\nthe early days of the 104th Congress. If the \\nCongress adopts such an amendment this \\nyear and it is ratified by three-quarters of \\nthe state legislatures in the next few years, \\nthe requirement could apply to the budget \\nfor fiscal year 2002. If the budget is to be bal-\\nanced by 2002, it is vitally important that \\nthe Congress and the President begin imme-\\ndiately to put into effect policies that will \\nachieve that goal. According to CBO’s latest \\nprojections of a baseline that assumes infla-\\ntion adjustments for discretionary spending \\nafter 1998, some combination of spending \\ncuts and tax increases totaling $322 billion in \\n2002 would be needed to eliminate the deficit \\nin that year. The amounts of deficit reduc-\\ntion called for in the years preceding 2002 de-\\npend both on the exact policies adopted and \\non when the process is started. \\n\\nFor illustrative purposes, CBO has devised \\none possible path leading to a balanced budg-\\net in 2002 (see Table 7). Starting from the \\nbaseline that assumes an inflation adjust-\\nment for discretionary spending after 1998 \\n(see Table 4), that path first shows the sav-\\nings that would be achieved if discretionary \\nspending were instead frozen at the dollar \\nlevel of the 1998 cap through 2002. Such a \\nfreeze, along with the resulting debt-service \\neffects, would produce $89 billion of the re-\\nquired savings of $322 billion in 2002. Under \\nthis freeze policy, the buying power of total \\ndiscretionary appropriations in 2002 would be \\napproximately 20 percent lower than in 1995. \\n\\nCBO also built into the illustrative path a \\npossible course of savings from further pol-\\nicy changes. The amounts of those savings \\nare not based on the adoption of any par-\\nticular set of policies, but they do assume \\nthat policy changes are phased in between \\n1996 and 1999 in a pattern that is similar to \\nthe changes in mandatory spending enacted \\nin the last two reconciliation acts. After \\n1999, the assumed savings increase at the \\nbaseline rate of growth for entitlement and \\nother mandatory spending, excluding Social \\nSecurity. Such a pattern of savings implies \\nthat the cuts implemented in earlier years \\nare permanent and that no additional policy \\nchanges are made. If those savings were \\nachieved entirely out of entitlement and \\nother mandatory programs (excluding Social \\nSecurity), they would represent about a 20 \\npercent reduction from current-policy levels \\nfor those programs. Over the entire 1996–2002 \\nperiod, the savings in CBO’s illustrative path \\nthat result directly from policy changes \\ntotal more than $1 trillion (in relation to a \\nbaseline that includes an inflation adjust-\\nment for discretionary spending after 1998). \\nWhen the resulting savings in debt-service \\npayments are included, the total exceeds $1.2 \\ntrillion. \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\nCBO’s most recent economic and budget \\nprojections underscore the challenge that \\nwill face policymakers who may have to \\nenact the spending cuts or tax increases \\nneeded to balance the budget by 2002. Al-\\nthough, the long-term budget outlook is no \\nworse now than it was last August, the new \\nprojections reinforce the fact that the deficit \\ncan be eliminated only through major \\nchanges in current policies. \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn

The \\n\\nChair recognizes the Senator from New \\nMexico. \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. \\nMr. President, first let me say to my \\n\\nfriend, Senator EXON, who will become \\nthe ranking member of the Budget \\nCommittee, I truly welcome you sit-\\nting with me in the Budget Committee. \\nYou will be right next to me, and I am \\nhopeful that what you are saying here \\ntoday in the Chamber means—and I be-\\nlieve it does—that as we try to put to-\\ngether a major deficit reduction pack-\\nage in the next 8 to 9 weeks, you will \\nbe here and that you will be at my side \\nas we try to do that. \\n\\nI want to say to the Senate and the \\npublic, the Senate Budget Committee \\nintends to make a very significant \\ndownpayment on a balanced budget. I \\ndo not believe in the very first budget \\nresolution that we propose that we can \\nbe expected to get to a balanced budg-\\net. \\n\\nFirst of all, we have not adopted the \\nconstitutional amendment. That \\nmeans the President of the United \\nStates is not bound by it, because until \\nwe have that, which would then be-\\ncome the law of the land, the President \\ndoes not have to give us a balanced \\nbudget format. We are on our own. \\n\\nI wish to submit to the Senate, if we \\ncome up with a budget deficit package, \\nI say to Senator NICKLES, that is any-\\nwhere from a $400 to $450 billion reduc-\\ntion over the game plan that is in ex-\\nistence right now, that will be a his-\\ntoric budget. It will start to make Gov-\\nernment smaller. It will start to \\nchange the underlying law of the land \\nso that instead of going up, the budget \\ndeficit will be down and down perma-\\nnently—perhaps, perhaps, I say to my \\nfriend, the occupant of the chair, down \\nas close as $100 billion 5 years from \\nnow, where today it is expected to be \\nover $300 billion. \\n\\nNow, I submit all of that can be done \\nif the Senate wants to do it. And while \\nI commend my friend from Nebraska, \\nwho is dedicated and devoted to a con-\\nstitutional amendment and balance, \\nwhile I submit that we are also, I do \\nnot believe we ought to be legislating \\nhow we implement a constitutional \\namendment here on the floor of the \\nSenate with a 15-minute introduction \\nof a major bill and 15 minutes to dis-\\ncuss it. This sounds more like what the \\nCongress of the United States will be \\nengaged in once the States send us this \\n\\nconstitutional amendment and say it is \\nthe law of the land. Then obviously \\nthat amendment says implement that \\nby statute law. This sounds more like \\nan advanced implementation done here \\nin the Chamber of the Senate with no \\nhearings and no discussion. \\n\\nI do not say that in any way to deni-\\ngrate the seriousness that Senator \\nEXON, the ranking member of the \\nBudget Committee, places on this \\nissue. It is important. It is important \\nthat we not send mixed signals to the \\npublic. If we send them a constitu-\\ntional amendment, we ought to make a \\nvery large downpayment, major down-\\npayment, on that deficit in this very \\nfirst budget resolution. \\n\\nIndeed, the Congressional Budget Of-\\nfice is warning us today and confirming \\nwhat some of us on this side have been \\nsaying that the last package of so- \\ncalled deficit reduction efforts did not \\nget the deficit down. It did for a very \\nshort period of time. But the under-\\nlying basic laws of the land were not \\nchanged enough, so that it is going \\nback up again. Our pledge is that in \\nour first resolution we will change that \\ntrend by forcing substantive law to be \\nchanged, and we will put everything on \\nthe table, fellow Senators. \\n\\nWe do not need this proposal. We are \\ngoing to put everything there except \\nSocial Security. And we are entitled to \\na reasonable period of time—3 \\nmonths—to see if we can do that. We \\ndo not need to change the Budget Act \\nor change the rules, implement a con-\\nstitutional amendment on the floor of \\nthe Senate. \\n\\nHaving said that, I understand this \\nmatter is debatable, but I would like to \\nmake a point of order, unless somebody \\nwants to speak, in which event I will \\nwithhold that, but it clearly violates \\nthe Budget Act and requires 60 votes \\nfrom what I understand. I see my \\nfriend, Senator NICKLES, standing. \\n\\nMr. NICKLES. Will the Senator with-\\nhold before he makes the point of \\norder—— \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to \\nwithhold. \\n\\nMr. NICKLES. So I can address the \\nSenate for a few minutes? \\n\\nMr. NICKLES addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Oklahoma has the floor. \\nMr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish \\n\\nto compliment Senator DOMENICI for \\nhis statement and also I compliment \\nour colleague from Nebraska for his \\nbill. I was hoping in a way it would be \\n\\na sense-of-the-Senate resolution. But I \\njust tell my colleague from Nebraska, \\nwho is now the ranking member of the \\nBudget Committee, I think the Budget \\nAct should be amended. I will work \\nwith him to amend it. I do not think it \\nshould be amended on the floor of the \\nSenate today. \\n\\nWe do not have to pass—I just make \\nmention to my colleagues—we do not \\nhave to pass every amendment that \\nmight be around in our first week in \\nsession. I know there are ideas on cam-\\npaign reform. There are ideas on lob-\\nbying reform. I hope the majority \\nwould like to pass a bill to make Con-\\ngress abide by the laws like everyone \\nelse in the country. The House has al-\\nready passed it and the Senate has not. \\nI really would like the Senate to pass \\nit. I introduced it in 1991. We did not \\nwin that time. I remember at that time \\nthe majority leader was Senator Mitch-\\nell. He spoke out very vigorously and \\nhe convinced a lot of people and we \\nlost. I would really like to pass it. I \\nwould like to pass it clean. \\n\\nI am interested in amending the \\nBudget Act. I think our budget proce-\\ndures do not work very well and one of \\nthe things I would like to change is our \\nbaseline so we do not have inflated \\nbaselines. That is something, now, that \\nhas gained some popularity. Maybe \\nthat can be in part of our Budget Act \\nResolution. \\n\\nThere are some other things we can \\ndo in the Budget Act, I think, that also \\nwould make sense. When the Senator \\nfrom Nebraska says that any budget \\nresolution should move us on a path to-\\nwards a balanced budget, I may well \\nsupport that. Maybe a direct path. We \\ncan negotiate that. But I think the \\nBudget Act probably needs some \\namendments and I will be happy to \\nwork with my colleague from Nebraska \\nto make that happen. \\n\\nI know there are some other amend-\\nments that need to be made to the \\nBudget Act in addition to this that is \\nbefore us today. This particular amend-\\nment does not have anything to do \\nwith making Congress abide by the \\nlaws like everybody else. There are 11 \\nstatutes from which Congress has ex-\\nempted itself, going all the way back \\nto 1935, and we are trying to remedy \\nthat. \\n\\nI know colleagues have amendments: \\nWe want to ban lobbying; we want to \\nban gifts; we want to ban this, and try \\nto correct everything that can possibly \\nbe wrong in our first week in session. \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES546 January 6, 1995 \\nWe are going to be in session next \\nweek. We are going to be in session the \\nfollowing week. The majority leader \\nhas already said we can take up several \\nof these issues soon. \\n\\nThe Senator from New Mexico said \\nwe are going to take up a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the budg-\\net. We are going to take up imple-\\nmenting legislation. We are going to \\ntake up a budget resolution. That hap-\\npens by statute. It has to happen, I be-\\nlieve, by April 15. We have to pass a \\njoint resolution implementing the \\nbudget resolution. So this is going to \\nhappen. It does not have to happen \\ntoday. \\n\\nSo the intent of my colleague from \\nNebraska, I think, is well made. But I \\nhope we will defer it, or postpone it, \\nand let us look at rewriting the Budget \\nAct. Let us not do it on this bill. Let us \\npass this bill as it is. I would like to \\npass it today. Let us send it to the \\nPresident and get his signature on it. I \\nthink it would be a positive accom-\\nplishment for this Congress and for \\nthis President. \\n\\nI yield the floor and I thank my col-\\nleague from New Mexico for yielding to \\nme. \\n\\nMr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in \\nsupport of the Exon amendment to bal-\\nance the budget. I am a longtime pro-\\nponent of balancing the Federal budget \\nand I believe the most effective manner \\nto do this is through an honest budg-\\neting process. This amendment will re-\\nquire truth in budgeting. I wish to add, \\nhowever, that my support for a bal-\\nanced budget is contingent on the ex-\\nemption of the Social Security trust \\nfund from its enforcement. An over-\\nwhelming majority of Americans sup-\\nport a balanced budget amendment but \\nnot at the expense of our Nation’s sen-\\nior citizens. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\nChair recognizes the Senator from New \\nMexico. \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I \\nfailed to mention one other argument I \\nwould like to lay before the Congress. I \\nsay to my good friend, as soon as the \\nconstitutional amendment is adopted \\nby the sovereign States and remitted \\nas it must under the Constitution, and \\nit becomes the sovereign law of the \\nland, there is a very different dynamic \\nthat takes place that we do not have \\ntoday. That is, we will not be the only \\npart of this Government that has to \\nproduce a budget resolution that is in \\nbalance because, by that time, the \\nPresident of the United States will \\nhave to submit one. The Congress of \\nthe United States and the President \\nwill be bound by the same generic sov-\\nereign law of the land, and I believe we \\nare going to move ahead with a very \\nsubstantial, large downpayment, prob-\\nably far in excess of what the President \\nwill submit, as our first efforts in the \\ncommittee. \\n\\nHaving said that, Mr. President, I \\nmake a point of order that the pending \\namendment violates the Budget Act of \\nthe United States. \\n\\nMr. EXON. addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Nebraska. \\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant \\n\\nto section 904(c) of the Congressional \\nBudget Act, I move to waive section 306 \\nof the act for the purpose of my amend-\\nment. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-\\ntion is debatable. The Chair recognizes \\nthe Senator from New Mexico. \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask \\nthat it be in order to ask for the yeas \\nand nays at this time. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in \\norder. \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask \\nfor the yeas and nays. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a \\nsufficient second? \\n\\nThere is a sufficient second. \\nThe yeas and nays were ordered. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\n\\nChair recognizes the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank \\nvery much my great friend and col-\\nleague, the chairman of the Budget \\nCommittee, and my friend from Okla-\\nhoma, who is also an important mem-\\nber of the Budget Committee, for the \\nkind statements. We have worked to-\\ngether on many, many things in the \\npast. I assure my chairman of the \\nBudget Committee that I will be there \\nwith him, I think as he knows. That \\ndoes not mean we are always going to \\nagree on every detail. But I think over \\nthe years, we have demonstrated the \\nfact that while we might disagree on \\nsome of the details, I am not certain \\nthat our goals have been very signifi-\\ncantly different. \\n\\nBack to the devil in the details—if we \\npass a constitutional amendment to \\nbalance the budget, then the devil will \\nbe in the details. What I am trying to \\ndo is to get a jump start on that. The \\nchairman of the Budget Committee has \\nindicated that we should not bring this \\nup on this particular bill. This is such \\na far-reaching bill that we cannot have \\na 15-minute debate, without any hear-\\nings, and then come to a conclusion. \\n\\nI am prepared to debate this for \\nwhatever length of time is necessary. I \\ndo not think we can only debate this \\nfor 15 minutes. There are no time \\nagreements that this Senator is aware \\nof at the present time. \\n\\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\\nsent Senator KOHL of Wisconsin be \\nadded as original cosponsor to the \\namendment that I have offered. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, the chair-\\nman of the Budget Committee seems to \\nbe saying, in one form or another, that \\nwe will comply with the balanced budg-\\net amendment at some later date. That \\nis just what I am concerned about. Why \\nwait? We all know, as evidenced by \\nwhat happened in the House of Rep-\\nresentatives earlier this week, that a \\nbalanced budget amendment of some \\nform is going to come over here; 80 per-\\ncent of the people of the United States, \\n\\nin several polls that I have seen, indi-\\ncate that they support a balanced \\nbudget amendment. Therefore, I think \\nit is very clear that we are going to \\nhave a balanced budget amendment be-\\nfore us and I intend to vote for it. \\n\\nWe only lost by, if I remember, two \\nor three votes on obtaining the re-\\nquired two-thirds in the last session of \\nthe Senate. So it is a foregone conclu-\\nsion that this is going to come to pass. \\nI am very much concerned, though, \\nwhen I hear my chairman of the Budg-\\net Committee talking about a down-\\npayment, a significant downpayment \\non the budget. I have just cited the \\nCBO report that indicates over 5 years, \\nthe budget deficit is going to be $130 \\nbillion to $150 billion more than pre-\\nviously anticipated. I cited in my open-\\ning statement the fact that the Con-\\ngressional Budget Office has said that \\nat a minimum, we are going to have to \\ncut $1.2 trillion from the budget by the \\nyear 2002. We are probably going to \\nhave some kind of a politically popular \\nmiddle-class tax cut, which will easily \\nswell that to $1.5 trillion. So I simply \\nsay this is not a time to wait. \\n\\nThe $500 billion downpayment that is \\nreferenced by the chairman of the \\nBudget Committee took a lot of hard \\nwork. But it lacks, as far as I know, \\nany real specifics at this time. That is \\nwhat I am concerned about. We are \\ngoing to rush to the passage of a con-\\nstitutional amendment to balance the \\nbudget without anyone having any idea \\nof the roadmap and the detail we are \\ngoing to have to use to get there. As I \\nsaid in my opening statement, it is like \\nbuilding a bridge to fantasy land with-\\nout specifying any pillars, and without \\neven specifying any hastily sketched \\nplan as to what the bridge is going to \\nlook like. \\n\\nIt seems to me that, as the senior \\nDemocrat on the Budget Committee, \\nthe Budget Committee of Republicans \\nand Democrats, we have a responsi-\\nbility, if indeed we are for a balanced \\nbudget amendment, which I think most \\nof the Members of this body are, that \\nin doing so we have the responsibility— \\nthat is what the Budget Committee is \\nall about—to study and to bring back \\nthe details of how we are going to \\nreach that goal, at least in some spe-\\ncific a fashion, as much as possible. \\nWhat we have to do, it seems to me, is \\nto show the way, to be specific. I do not \\nthink we can wait. \\n\\nIf I had some assurance that the \\namendment that I have offered would \\nbe considered in an up or down major-\\nity vote sometime in the immediate fu-\\nture, then I might not be pressing this \\ntoday. However, I have a strong belief \\nthat the more we delay in doing what \\nthe Exon amendment says we have to \\ndo, the more we are going to be suspect \\nin the eyes of the American people. I \\nam afraid that many of the American \\npeople would think passing a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the budg-\\net will just take care of everything. I \\nsay to the Chair and I say to my col-\\nleagues, the easiest thing in the world \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S547 January 6, 1995 \\nto do is to pass a constitutional amend-\\nment to balance the budget which ev-\\nerybody would say amen to; 80 percent \\nof the people in the United States and \\nprobably 60 to 80 percent of the Mem-\\nbers of the Congress would say that is \\na great idea without fully under-\\nstanding the difficult role that all are \\ngoing to have to play in getting from \\nhere to there by the year 2002. \\n\\nOne thing that comes to mind, Mr. \\nPresident, very clearly is the indica-\\ntion of the chairman of the Budget \\nCommittee and I compliment Senator \\nDOMENICI for the hard work he did in \\ncoming up at least with some figures in \\nthe $400 billion to $500 billion range. \\nBut that is over a 5-year period. If we \\nwould accept that and if the balanced \\nbudget amendment is ratified by the \\nStates, which I presume it would be, \\nand if we go along with what is rec-\\nommended by the chairman of the \\nBudget Committee, then at best we \\nwould be less than halfway and maybe \\nonly a third of the way to the $1.2 to \\n$1.5 trillion realistic amount of cuts \\nthat we are going to have to make to \\nget there. \\n\\nI simply say, Mr. President, by op-\\nposing this amendment, I think we are \\nsending far more mixed signals to the \\npeople of the United States as to where \\nthe Congress is going and where it is \\nnot going and probably how serious we \\nare about passing a politically popular \\nconstitutional amendment to balance \\nthe budget. \\n\\nOn the subject of hearings, that has \\nbeen brought up, let me note specifi-\\ncally for the record that this body \\npassed a very famed Gramm-Rudman- \\nHollings. We saw that come to the floor \\nof the U.S. Senate without 1 minute of \\nhearing. I simply say that a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the Fed-\\neral budget has been discussed. Hear-\\nings were held on it for a long, long \\ntime. It is not a particularly com-\\nplicated piece of legislation in and of \\nitself. It just creates a constitutional \\namendment that has to be passed by \\nboth bodies and sent to the States \\nwhere 75 percent of the States would \\nhave to ratify that before it becomes \\nlaw. I simply say that if we passed \\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings way back in \\n1985 without hearings, which in some \\nways was a very complicated piece of \\nlegislation, then we do not have to \\nhave more hearings on this subject be-\\ncause we know we are going to pass it \\nanyway. Certainly, I must say that I \\nbelieve the chairman of the Budget \\nCommittee is very sincere in his belief. \\nBut this is one of those cases that I in-\\ndicated earlier which it just so happens \\nthat good friends who I think are work-\\ning in the same direction do not agree \\non how fast we should move. \\n\\nThe chairman of the Budget Com-\\nmittee wants to wait for ratification of \\nthe constitutional amendment seem-\\ningly before we do anything more dy-\\nnamic than the $400 to $500 billion grab \\nbag of reductions that have been sug-\\ngested. I know the chairman has \\nworked very hard on those. I do not \\n\\nmean to say that his task was not sin-\\ncere. I do say, though, that if all we are \\ngoing to do is to come up with $500 bil-\\nlion in possible savings, then if we are \\ngoing to wait around for the States to \\nratify, the months and years are going \\nto go by and then the next Congress of \\nthe United States and maybe the one \\nafter that or the one after that will be \\nfacing a 2-year period between the year \\n2000 and the year 2002 when they are \\ngoing to have to cut $1 trillion or \\nsomewhere in that area over and be-\\nyond, assuming we enact all of the cuts \\nof the roughly $500 billion that has \\nbeen named in one fashion or another \\nby the chairman of the Budget Com-\\nmittee. \\n\\nI think more than anything else, Mr. \\nPresident, that demonstrates the need \\nthat, if we are sincere about this, we \\nhave to do much more than the timely \\nwork that has been done by the chair-\\nman of the Budget Committee with the \\nreference to the $400 to $500 billion that \\nhas been identified loosely in one fash-\\nion or another. I am afraid that we \\ncannot wait. We must not wait or we \\nare going to send the signal to the \\nAmerican people that after their \\nStates ratify a constitutional amend-\\nment, then we will get on with our \\nbusiness of balancing the budget. \\n\\nIf we are sincere, then I think we \\nshould start making recommendations \\nnow, making cuts now that we know \\nwe are going to have to do anyway. I \\nsimply say that putting off the hard \\nchoices until after a constitutional \\nprovision is ratified by the States \\nwould be a step in the wrong direction. \\n\\nMr. President, the Senator from \\nOklahoma says that there is nothing in \\nmy amendment dealing with applying \\nthe laws of Congress. What greater law \\nis there in applying laws of Congress to \\nthe laws that we have imposed on the \\npeople than offering them a constitu-\\ntional amendment but then saying but \\nwe are not going to get into the details \\nof this until you make your determina-\\ntion? I happen to believe that the \\nBudget Committee, the House of Rep-\\nresentatives Budget Committee, the \\nSenate Budget Committee, respective \\nbodies have an obligation to spell out \\nin as much detail as we possibly can \\nwhat it is going to take, what the sac-\\nrifices are that are going to have to be \\nmade to reach the balanced budget by \\nthe year 2002. That is why I said in my \\nopening statement that unless we do \\nsomething more than what has been \\ndone now, I am afraid that we are \\nbringing forth a sham on the American \\npeople. Certainly I do not believe that \\nthe American people want any more \\nshams. I guess that was one of the con-\\nclusions that this one Democratic Sen-\\nator from a Republican State took \\nfrom the last election. \\n\\nI, therefore, say delaying the deci-\\nsions that have to be made is not only \\nunwise and unsound fiscal policy of \\nwhich we have been on for far too \\nmany years, but it is also not satisfac-\\ntory. It is not carrying out our respon-\\nsibility to tell the people of the United \\n\\nStates of America to tell the legisla-\\ntures of the 50 sovereign States of the \\nUnited States and to tell all interested \\nparties how we might be able to get \\nthere in the year 2002. \\n\\nI simply say that you do not have to \\nbe a mathematical genius to recognize \\nthe fact that we are going to twiddle \\nour thumbs and not do more than has \\nbeen thus far recommended—and again \\nI salute him for the recommendations \\nhe has made. But if we are going to sit \\nand twiddle our thumbs for 5 years and \\nsay we are going to cut about $500 bil-\\nlion in this fashion, then when and if \\nthe States ratify the measure, that \\nCongress, both the Members of the \\nHouse and the U.S. Senate, are going \\nto be in dire circumstances indeed. And \\nwe will be faced with the proposition of \\neither extending the year 2002 to some \\nother date 7 or 8 years into the future \\nbeyond that, or they are going to have \\nto make more draconian cuts than \\nthey can make in the budget that is \\nstill running to a large extent out of \\nhand, and/or they would have to pass \\nsuch massive tax increases to meet the \\nyear 2002 that it would be universally \\nunpopular with 80 or 90 percent of the \\npeople of the United States of America. \\nIf that is not enough, such a tax in-\\ncrease would certainly send the United \\nStates of America into a deep, deep de-\\npression, not unlike what some of us \\nremember happened back in the 1930’s. \\n\\nTherefore, I renew my plea, Mr. \\nPresident, and say that there is noth-\\ning revolutionary about the Exon \\namendment. The Exon amendment is \\nstraightforward. I think the amend-\\nment, if people sit and study it on both \\nsides of the aisle, could simply be \\nsummed up that if you are for a con-\\nstitutional amendment to balance the \\nbudget, then you have to be for the \\nExon amendment or you are not being \\nfully square with the American people. \\n\\nI yield the floor. \\nMrs. BOXER addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would say to the majority leader \\nthat I do not intend a filibustering ac-\\ntion on this, but when the chairman of \\nthe Budget Committee said something \\nearlier about only having 15 minutes to \\ndebate that, that came as a big sur-\\nprise to me. I do not know, nor did I \\nhear, what the majority leader said a \\nfew moments ago about some kind of a \\nvote between 1 or 2 o’clock sometime. I \\nam here ready to debate and do busi-\\nness. \\n\\nI believe there are some other indi-\\nviduals that would very much like the \\nopportunity to possibly come over and \\nsay a few words on this. I had not an-\\nticipated that we would vote that \\n\\nearly. However, I recognize the par-\\nliamentary rights of the other side to \\nmake a motion to table at any par-\\nticular time. May I ask of the majority \\nleader, why do we want to vote on this \\nat 1:05 when I have some other things I \\nwould like to say on this myself? The \\nSenator from California has indicated \\nsome interest in it, as has the Senator \\nfrom Arkansas. What is the rush to \\nvote by 1:05? \\n\\nMr. DOLE. There is no rush, but I can \\nmove to table right now and we can \\nvote at 12:55. We can always do that. \\nWe do not have to wait until 1:05. I am \\ntrying to accommodate the Senators \\non each side, including this Senator, \\nbut we will vote at 4 o’clock then. \\nWould that be all right? \\n\\nMr. EXON. Yes, 4 o’clock is all right. \\nMr. DOLE. I do not want to vote at 4 \\n\\no’clock. But we are going to do a lot of \\nwork here today. We are not going to \\nhave one or two votes today, because \\nwe are trying to finish this bill by \\nMonday evening. I do not see any way \\nthat is going to happen. I do not have \\nany quarrel with the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska taking all the time he wishes, \\nup to some reasonable point. At that \\npoint, we would move to table. But be-\\ncause he has not had much time for de-\\nbate—— \\n\\nMr. EXON. May I say, Mr. President, \\nto the majority leader that certainly I \\nwould think that I could agree now to \\na vote not later than 4 o’clock, with \\nthe time between now and then equally \\ndivided. We might be able to speed it \\nup, depending on how many want to \\ntalk. \\n\\nMr. DOLE. I would rather not make \\nthat request now. I know some Mem-\\nbers have other plans this afternoon— \\nnot this Member, but other Members \\non both sides of the aisle—who would \\nlike to not only complete this amend-\\nment but a couple of others and maybe \\nget an agreement. As I understand it, \\nthere will be a meeting at 1 o’clock on \\nthe other side to see if we can reach \\nsome agreement so those who had \\namendments could stay and debate \\nthem. Those who did not have amend-\\nments could keep their commitments, \\nin some cases far away from here. We \\nare trying to accommodate all Sen-\\nators. So I would not want to wait \\nuntil 4 o’clock. Why do we not just say \\nwe will revisit it in 30 or 45 minutes? \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I under-\\nstand the difficult task the majority \\nleader has, and I think usually I have \\ncooperated, and I want to cooperate \\nnow. He has indicated probably we will \\nnot finish this bill today and we may \\nbe stacking some votes and vote next \\nweek. \\n\\nMr. DOLE. Next week means next \\nMonday. Probably votes will occur \\nafter 3 o’clock. In any event, I know \\nthe distinguished minority leader, Sen-\\nator DASCHLE, will be meeting at 1 \\no’clock to see how many amendments \\nwill be remaining on that side. We are \\nperfectly prepared to reach agreement \\nso that those who have amendments \\ncan stay and debate them but not vote. \\n\\nBut we would like to vote on this one \\ntoday. \\n\\nMr. EXON. I would prefer, frankly, if \\nI could, to stay here and debate this \\nhowever late and possibly stack the \\nvote on the Exon amendment along \\nwith any other votes that the majority \\nleader wishes to stack next week, or \\nwhatever is his pleasure. \\n\\nMr. DOLE. My pleasure would be not \\nto do that. \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\n\\nChair recognizes the Senator from New \\nMexico. \\n\\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do \\nnot want to deny the Senator time. \\nAnd I hope he did not interpret my say-\\ning 15 minutes—I had inquired of his \\nstaff how long the Senator intended to \\nspeak and they said 15 minutes and I, \\nquite inappropriately, assumed that \\nwas the extent of the debate. I clearly \\ndo not intend to hold anybody to 15 \\nminutes. That is what I understood. \\n\\nMr. EXON. I thank the Senator. \\nMr. PRYOR addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. \\n\\nCOCHRAN). The Senator from Arkansas. \\nMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I had not \\n\\nplanned to speak this afternoon. I cer-\\ntainly do not want to obstruct the flow \\nof legislative business here. \\n\\nFirst, I would like to compliment my \\ncolleague and friend from Nebraska on \\nhis proposal this afternoon. I also want \\nto say that I cannot support it at this \\ntime. \\n\\nI would like to bring to the attention \\nof my colleagues, Mr. President, the \\nfact that in one section of the amend-\\nment offered by the distinguished Sen-\\nator from Nebraska, which the Senate \\nthis afternoon, in just a few minutes of \\ndebate, is going to be asked vote on, \\nstates that it is ‘‘essential that Con-\\ngress, one, adopt a balanced budget \\namendment.’’ That is one thing that \\nthe Exon amendment proposes to do. \\n\\nSo we, after a very few moments and \\na very small skirmish on a very large \\nconstitutional issue, Mr. President, are \\ngoing to be required in a few moments, \\nwith many absences—I assume some of \\nour colleagues have gone back to their \\nStates, to vote on whether or not we \\nthink ‘‘the Congress should adopt a \\nbalanced budget amendment.’’ Maybe \\nwe think that the Congress should; \\nmaybe we think the Congress should \\nnot. But this is a very, very far-reach-\\ning proposal. \\n\\nMr. President, my colleague and \\nfriend from Nebraska stated in the \\nopening moments of his very eloquent \\npresentation the fact that the Amer-\\nican public, by overwhelming numbers, \\nsays, yes, we need a balanced budget \\nand we need a constitutional amend-\\nment to balance the budget. I think \\nthere was a CBS poll or one of the poll-\\ning operations that reported today or \\nyesterday that a great majority of \\nthose polled say we need a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the budg-\\net. \\n\\nMr. President, I know there is a great \\neuphoria around the Capitol these \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S549 January 6, 1995 \\ndays, but I do not think that euphoria \\nis of such magnitude and intensity and \\nvelocity at this moment that the \\nAmerican people might not give us say \\na few months, a few months, perhaps \\neven in the summer, early fall or Octo-\\nber, certainly before we leave, to let us \\ndecide whether or not we want to pro-\\npose to the 50 States that an amend-\\nment to the Federal Constitution be \\nadopted to require a balanced budget. \\n\\nThe Exon proposal, in my opinion, is \\na very, very responsible proposal be-\\ncause it will require, Mr. President, the \\npolicies to be specified that would be \\nrequired to enforce a balanced budget \\namendment or, to say it in another \\nway—I assume I am speaking with \\nsome degree of correctness—it would \\nimply that there would have to be im-\\nplementing legislation that would have \\nto go along with a balanced budget \\namendment. I think that is a respon-\\nsible course of action. \\n\\nI think, Mr. President, for us to this \\nafternoon, on Friday, with a short de-\\nbate, to even take a position on wheth-\\ner we want to, require 60 votes to waive \\na point of order—that is a new order of \\nconsideration provided by the Exon \\namendment—is questionable. We even \\ngo back to a procedure under the old \\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings concept that \\nprovides that the point of order will be \\nsuspended if Congress declares war or \\nadopts a resolution certifying low eco-\\nnomic growth. This is another ques-\\ntion. \\n\\nBut the Senator from Nebraska has \\nput his finger on one of the most im-\\nportant things, and that is, do the peo-\\nple want us to vote for a balanced \\nbudget amendment before we know the \\nfacts? \\n\\nNow, do we know the facts, Mr. \\nPresident? No, we do not know the \\nfacts. When we know the facts, then it \\nwill be the proper time and the proper \\nopportunity for us to vote yes or no on \\nwhether we prefer a balanced budget \\namendment to the Federal Constitu-\\ntion. \\n\\nI hope that there will be some way to \\naccommodate the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska. I wish we could debate this \\neven until next week, because I do not \\nsee the necessity to rush an amend-\\nment like this through, one of such im-\\nportant consequences, for which I do \\napplaud my colleague and friend from \\nNebraska. \\n\\nMr. EXON addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Nebraska. \\nMr. EXON. I thank my friend and \\n\\ncolleague from Arkansas. I will be very \\nbrief, I say to my friend from Pennsyl-\\nvania. \\n\\nI thank the Senator for his very kind \\nremarks and observations. I, too, would \\nlike to put off the vote on this until \\nnext week, as I indicated in my con-\\nversations with the majority leader. \\n\\nThere is not anything very revolu-\\ntionary about this proposal. I would \\nsimply explain to the Senator from Ar-\\nkansas that if we did not pass a con-\\nstitutional amendment to balance the \\n\\nbudget, that even if we passed the Exon \\namendment it would have no real ef-\\nfect. The Exon amendment would only \\nhave effect if and when we do pass a \\nconstitutional amendment. \\n\\nThe reason I think it is appropriate \\nto address this now is that we are talk-\\ning about applying the same rules to \\nthe Congress as we do to the people. I \\nthink it follows, then, that if we are \\ngoing to rush pell-mell, as I suggested \\nwe are going to do—we are not going to \\nwait several months, I suggest, as the \\nSenator from Arkansas said he would \\nlike to see. I think that the first 100 \\ndays, maybe the first 10 days, at least \\nthe first 10 weeks of this session are \\ngoing to be very climactic ones and I \\nam very fearful that things are going \\nto be rolled through over here very rap-\\nidly. \\n\\nWhat this Exon amendment does is \\nsimply send out the signal that when \\nand if we do pass a constitutional \\namendment, then we have the responsi-\\nbility to direct the Budget Committee \\nto come back with some details, rather \\nthan passing the amendment and wor-\\nrying about the details afterwards. \\n\\nI thank my friend from Arkansas for \\nhis observations. \\n\\nMr. President, let me say I just want \\nto correct myself. It does have an ef-\\nfect whether we pass the balanced \\nbudget amendment or not. It really \\nsays that if we proceed, we proceed in \\nan orderly fashion, which is what the \\namendment is all about. \\n\\nI yield the floor. \\nMr. SPECTER addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Pennsylvania. \\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there \\n\\nis no disagreement on the floor today \\nabout the desirability of having a bal-\\nanced budget so that the Federal Gov-\\nernment would live within its means as \\nevery other governmental entity, like \\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \\nhas a constitutional requirement to \\nhave a balanced budget. Every city and \\ncounty in my State and every govern-\\nmental unit across the country has to \\nlive within its means within a balanced \\nbudget. Only the Federal Government \\nhas the prerogative to print money, \\nscript, and borrow and not live within \\nits means. This is an affront to every \\nfamily, and the comment has often \\nbeen made on this floor. \\n\\nIn the 14 years-plus that I have been \\nin this body, we have debated and \\ntalked about this subject, I think, \\nmore than any other and there is I \\nthink agreement that we need a bal-\\nanced budget. \\n\\nYesterday, in the Judiciary Com-\\nmittee, we had a very constructive \\nhearing analyzing many legal consider-\\nations on enacting a constitutional \\namendment for a balanced budget. I \\nthink we will soon do that. The amend-\\nment proposed by the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska on its face does something a lit-\\ntle different. That is, it ‘‘enforces \\nthrough the congressional budget proc-\\ness the requirement to achieve a bal-\\nanced Federal budget.’’ \\n\\nThe distinguished chairman of the \\nBudget Committee has raised an under-\\nstandable objection to this point in \\ntying the hands of the Budget Com-\\nmittee this afternoon with very little \\ndebate and only a few Senators on the \\nfloor, tying the hands of the Budget \\nCommittee on what it will do. I would \\nsuggest to the Senator from Nebraska \\nthat the preferable course would be for \\nthe Senator from Nebraska in his posi-\\ntion as the senior Democrat on the \\nBudget Committee to offer the specific \\namendments to achieve a balanced \\nbudget. One of the difficulties in the \\nSenate and the House has been that we \\nhave done a lot of talking about the de-\\nsirability of a balanced budget, but no \\none has come forward and introduced \\non the floor the specifics of a balanced \\nbudget. \\n\\nSo I would say to the Senator from \\nNebraska, as the ranking member, the \\nsenior Democrat on the Budget Com-\\nmittee, let him come forward with the \\nspecifics. He wants a balanced budget. \\nWe all do. He thinks he can propose a \\nbalanced budget this year. Let him do \\nso. Let him take it to the committee or \\nlet him take it to the floor and then we \\nwill vote on it. \\n\\nI expect to be a chairman of the Ap-\\npropriations subcommittee this session \\non Labor, Health, Human Services and \\nEducation, a committee I have served \\non in the 14 years-plus I have been in \\nthe Senate, and was ranking member \\nlast year. I have already called the \\nSecretaries of each of those depart-\\nments and have said to them, what are \\nyou going to be asking for by way of \\nappropriations next year? What is it \\nthat may be eliminated? What is it \\nthat we may be able to cut on the \\nbudget in terms of specifics? I think \\nthere is no doubt that the mandate of \\nlast November’s election was that the \\nAmerican people want smaller Govern-\\nment, want reduced spending, and \\nwould like to see tax cuts. \\n\\nI believe that we should have tax \\ncuts but I am not prepared to vote for \\na tax cut sight unseen. I am not pre-\\npared to engage in the bidding on a \\nmiddle-class tax cut until we see that \\nwe have savings. I do not think we \\nshould have tax cuts if it will add to \\nthe deficit. I do think, parenthetically, \\nwe should have promptly a capital \\ngains tax cut. That is the one tax cut \\nwhich we could enact promptly which \\nwould not lead to a revenue loss. There \\nwere 56 Members of this body in the \\nlast session of Congress prepared to \\nhave a capital gains tax cut. We could \\nnot get it through against a filibuster. \\nThat is one tax cut we could have. \\n\\nAs to others, we ought not to be in \\nthat bidding war until we see what \\nspending cuts we will have. Now, as the \\nprospective chairman of the Sub-\\ncommittee of Labor, Health, Human \\nServices and Education with a discre-\\ntionary budget of approximately $70 \\nbillion, I am looking for places to cut. \\nBut I am not prepared to make cuts \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES550 January 6, 1995 \\nwith a meat ax but instead with a scal-\\npel. I am not prepared to talk about \\nthe generalizations. \\n\\nI think that the distinguished Sen-\\nator from New Mexico, Senator DOMEN-\\nICI, the chairman of the Budget Com-\\nmittee, is exactly right when he says, \\nas the chairman with the responsibility \\nto direct those deliberations, that he \\ndoes not want to see an enforcement \\nmechanism which will compel the \\nBudget Committee to take action be-\\nfore the Budget Committee has a \\nchance to go through the items line by \\nline, which is what the Senator from \\nArkansas, Senator PRYOR, is in effect \\nsaying. What I am saying, is take a \\nlook at the specifics of the budget on \\nLabor, Health, Human Services and \\nEducation, three committees that have \\ndiscretionary budgets up to $70 billion. \\n\\nThe other two provisions in the \\namendment by the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska I think are not worthy of adop-\\ntion. The first one is to adopt in the \\nfirst session of the 104th Congress, a \\njoint resolution proposing, an amend-\\nment to the Constitution requiring, a \\nbalanced Federal budget. We are al-\\nready considering that. It will not do \\nany good to talk any more about that \\nuntil the Judiciary Committee reports \\nout an amendment and we act on it on \\nthe Senate floor. \\n\\nThe second line to set forth with \\nspecificity in the first session of the \\n104th Congress is what the policies of \\nachieving such a balanced Federal \\nbudget would require. Mr. President, I \\nthink we are well aware at this stage of \\nthe life of the Congress of what the \\npolicies are. I would say that although \\nthis matter is worthy of debate it has \\nbeen on the floor for a little more than \\nan hour. I do not see any avalanche of \\nSenators coming to the floor to debate \\nthe resolution. \\n\\nWhat we ought to be doing at this \\npoint is talking about the specifics. \\nTalking about the specifics in my sub-\\ncommittee and talking about the spe-\\ncifics in the Budget Committee. I \\nwould invite the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska to propose the details as to how \\nhe would balance the budget. I can as-\\nsure that this Senator will look closely \\nat that role and would work with him \\nin trying to balance a budget with real \\nmoney. Not a confederate proposition \\nof ‘‘let’s talk about it,’’ but let Mem-\\nbers be specific about how we will do it. \\nI join him in that effort. \\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Nebraska \\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I certainly \\n\\nthank my colleague and friend from \\nPennsylvania for his remarks, as much \\nas I disagree with them. Certainly, the \\nSenator from Pennsylvania knows, as I \\nbelieve the chairman of the Budget \\nCommittee knows, and as he has indi-\\ncated in remarks on this debate this \\nafternoon, that the ranking Democrat \\non the Budget Committee will and is \\nprepared to play a role in developing a \\nlist of possibilities that we could come \\nup with. \\n\\nThis does not fall solely on one Sen-\\nator, just as it does not fall on any one \\nSenator as to what is done in the \\nHealth and Labor Committee, the Judi-\\nciary Committee, or anything else. \\n\\nI would simply say that I will be \\nworking with the Republican majority \\nthe control of all of the committees \\nand all of the subcommittees to jointly \\nwork out something. This is not a sole \\nexercise on any Member’s part. \\n\\nThe Exon amendment that is cur-\\nrently before us simply tries to define \\nthe difficult task that we have in front \\nof us. It simply says that whether we \\npass the balanced budget amendment \\nor not, and I think we will, we still \\nhave a serious, serious, deficit problem \\non our hands. I think the Budget Com-\\nmittee should play a key role in this. \\n\\nAnd in answer to the suggestions of \\nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, I will \\nbe working very closely with the other \\nmembers of the Budget Committee, \\nwhether or not the Exon amendment is \\nadopted, in the name of fiscal responsi-\\nbility, where I have been working now, \\nfor a long, long time. \\n\\nThe Senator from Pennsylvania has \\nremarked on the valuable hearings \\nthat the Judiciary Committee has been \\nholding regarding the enforcement of \\nthe balanced budget amendment. As he \\nprobably noted, and this is also a con-\\ncern of this Senator, one of the impor-\\ntant considerations under that amend-\\nment is whether and how the courts— \\nthe courts, I emphasize—might enforce \\nthe balanced budget amendment. That \\nis one of the reasons that I offered the \\namendment that I have. I do not think \\nthat the courts should be making these \\ndecisions. They should be made here in \\nthe U.S. Senate and in the House of \\nRepresentatives. \\n\\nMy amendment, contrary to what I \\nam afraid my friend from Pennsylvania \\nthought, helps clear some of that up by \\nmandating that the real congressional \\nenforcement by specifics would be out-\\nlined, therefore, keeping, hopefully, en-\\ndorsement in Congress and out of the \\ncourts, where I think none of us thinks \\nit belongs. \\n\\nI think we need to talk specifics. I \\nthink we need to talk specifics not as \\nindividual Senators but in the Budget \\nCommittee, and in the other commit-\\ntees of the Congress that have some ju-\\nrisdiction. We need to start planning \\nnow where we are going to go between \\nnow and the year 2002. I object very \\nstrenuously to some of the talk that \\nhas been carried forth here. With re-\\ngard to that we do not have to rush \\ninto this. We do need to rush in, I sug-\\ngest, to some kind of a blueprint that \\nwould give us some kind of a guide, \\nsome kind of an understanding by the \\npeople at large on where we are going \\nto go, ask how we are going to get \\nthere. \\n\\nLet us make no mistake about it, we \\nhave to work together. But let us also \\nmake no mistake about it that, as the \\nlast election clearly indicates, while \\nthe Republicans are in the majority \\nhere, I have said time and time again \\n\\nduring this debate, and will be saying \\nit in the future, that I will work as a \\ndedicated Member of the loyal opposi-\\ntion, not being an obstructionist but \\npointing out fiscal responsibility and \\nwhere I think we should be going, not \\ntaking the easy road and simply say-\\ning, ‘‘Let’s just go ahead and pass this \\nconstitutional amendment to the budg-\\net. Then if the States, in their wisdom, \\n75 percent of them, ratify this, we will \\nget down to the basics.’’ \\n\\nI think that is not the way to go, and \\nI am very fearful that that is the \\ncourse that we are about to travel. I \\nunderstand that the minority leader \\nwill be on the floor shortly to talk on \\nthis subject. I yield the floor. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I \\nsuggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\nclerk will call the roll. \\n\\nThe assistant legislative clerk pro-\\nceeded to call the roll. \\n\\nMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask \\nunanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would \\nlike to fill in a little time, if my col-\\nleagues do not object—but when the \\nminority leader comes to the floor, I \\nwill cease my remarks. \\n\\nI would like to make just two or \\nthree more points, Mr. President. I \\nthink that what the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska is doing, the concept that he is \\nlaying out is absolutely sound. I think \\nit is responsible, and I think that it is \\nsomething we have to do prior to the \\nvote on a balanced budget amendment. \\nThere may be a lot of different thought \\nin this Chamber as to what the out-\\ncome of this debate might or might not \\nbe. \\n\\nSecond, I think we need to know \\nsome more basic things about a bal-\\nanced budget amendment. I think we \\nneed to know how we are going to \\nachieve a balanced budget, and if some \\nSenators say, ‘‘Oh, we have 7 or 8 years \\nto figure that out; we’ll just vote the \\nbalanced budget amendment in and we \\nwill feel good; we will write a press re-\\nlease; we will go back home and we will \\nboast that we have voted for a balanced \\nbudget amendment,’’ that does not \\ntake a lot of creativity, nor a lot of \\ncourage. \\n\\nI think what we have to ask our-\\nselves is this: How are we going to \\nachieve a balanced budget if we adopt \\nthe balanced budget amendment? What \\nwill be the implementing legislation \\nthat will be called for? What is going to \\nbe the issue with regard to rescission? \\nWhat is going to be the answer with re-\\ngard to impoundment? Are we going to \\nbasically exclude or include Social Se-\\ncurity? Are we going to exclude or in-\\nclude veterans benefits? \\n\\nThese are the types of issues, Mr. \\nPresident, that I think we need to \\nknow before we stake out the course of \\nthis afternoon, saying it is a congres-\\nsional decision, that it is essential for \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S551 January 6, 1995 \\nCongress to adopt a balanced budget \\namendment. \\n\\nThe Senator from Pennsylvania stat-\\ned there is no disagreement among \\nanyone, I think, in this Chamber of \\nwhether we need a balanced budget. \\nThat is different from a balanced budg-\\net amendment, I say respectfully, and I \\ncertainly agree with my colleague and \\nfriend from Pennsylvania. But we have \\na lot of things going on here. We have \\nthe Contract With America. Some of it \\nhas already started to roll. Things are \\nhappening very quickly. \\n\\nWe are going to have a markup on \\nMonday, I believe, in the Governmental \\nAffairs Committee, on an issue that \\nmay or may not change the relation-\\nship between the Federal and State \\ngovernments. That is a voluminous \\npiece of legislation. It is a piece of leg-\\nislation that I will probably vote for. \\nBut, Mr. President, I do not think we \\nare taking enough time to really look \\nand analyze some of these far-reaching \\npieces of legislation before we cast our \\nvote. \\n\\nBut a constitutional amendment to \\nthe Federal Constitution to require a \\nbalanced budget I think should be \\nvoted on when we have the facts, when \\nwe know how we are going to achieve \\nand how we will implement that bal-\\nanced budget that all of us may ulti-\\nmately support. \\n\\nMr. President, those are the com-\\nments that I have. I see other Senators \\nmay be coming to the floor desiring to \\nspeak. So with that I will yield the \\nfloor, and I will suggest the absence of \\na quorum. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unan-\\nimous consent that the order for the \\nquorum call be rescinded. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator \\nfrom West Virginia. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have \\nthe floor? \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator does have the floor. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I ask \\nunanimous consent that I may, as the \\nSenator who has the floor, propound a \\nquestion to the Senator from Nebraska \\nwithout losing my right to the floor. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection to the request? Without ob-\\njection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. My question is this, may \\nI say to the distinguished Senator: \\nWould the Senator be willing to revise \\nhis proposal in a way that would delete \\nthe language that is set forth in para-\\ngraph (1) and in (a), preceding (1), \\nwhich reads as follows: \\n\\nPURPOSE.—The Congress declares it essen-\\ntial that the Congress— \\n\\n(1) adopt in the first session of the 104th \\nCongress a joint resolution proposing an \\namendment to the Constitution requiring a \\nbalanced Federal budget. \\n\\nMr. President, before he responds, \\nthere are some other aspects of this \\n\\nproposal that the distinguished Sen-\\nator has made here that I like. I think \\nhe is not willing to go into this thing \\nwith his eyes shut. He is not willing \\njust to go along with having a con-\\nstitutional amendment on a balanced \\nbudget, although I believe I heard him \\nsay he was going to vote for one. I hope \\nhe will, in his characteristic fashion, \\nthink that through. I have always \\nthought of him as a man who really \\nthinks matters through, and the fact \\nthat he has offered this as a proposal \\ntoday indicates to me that he is think-\\ning that through and that he sees some \\nproblems with it. \\n\\nI like most of what the Senator has, \\nbut I do not like and could never sup-\\nport (a) and (1): \\n\\nThe Congress declares it essential that the \\nCongress adopt in the first session of the \\n104th Congress a joint resolution proposing \\nan amendment to the Constitution requiring \\na balanced Federal budget. \\n\\nI am not for that. I will not be for it \\ntomorrow, and I am going to do every-\\nthing I can to oppose that for reasons \\nthat I will explain later. \\n\\nNow, would the Senator consider re-\\nvising his proposal so as to leave out \\nthat language to which I object strenu-\\nously? \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, in response \\nto my friend and colleague from West \\nVirginia, I hear his sound and wise ad-\\nvice very clearly. You are not the only \\nSenator that has raised that question, \\nbut you are the first one. \\n\\nI will certainly say I have a right to \\nrevise the amendment. I have it under \\nconsideration to revise it at this time. \\n\\nAs I take it, if I would revise the \\namendment and any amendment any-\\none ever writes, we could say after-\\nwards, ‘‘Had I had it to do over again, \\nI would have struck this way.’’ \\n\\nIf I could anticipate the support of \\nthe distinguished Senator from West \\nVirginia, I take it that he would sim-\\nply say that we would strike lines 7, 8, \\nand 9, and strike ‘‘(2)’’ in line 10 and \\nmake that ‘‘(1)’’; likewise, on line 3, on \\nthe second page, strike ‘‘1’’ and make \\nit ‘‘2,’’ that the Senator would feel, \\nwith those changes, he would be in a \\nposition to support the amendment? \\n\\nMr. BYRD. The Senator is getting \\nvery close. He is getting very close. I \\ndo not want to say right here that I \\nwould support that as the Senator has \\noutlined the precise changes, but he is \\nmoving in the direction, and I would \\nlike to see what he puts in as (a). I \\nwould like to see what goes in in lieu of \\nwhat is being taken out. \\n\\nMr. EXON. May I ask the Senator \\nfrom Arkansas, who has also spoken to \\nme privately about this general sub-\\nject, if he agrees with the discussion \\nthat just took place between the Sen-\\nator from West Virginia and this Sen-\\nator. \\n\\nI would certainly say that I am one \\nof those who for a long time has sup-\\nported a constitutional amendment to \\nbalance the budget, and I intend to \\nsupport one when it is finally presented \\nin some form, if that form does not \\n\\nraise too many barriers. If I am pre-\\nsented with a constitutional amend-\\nment that says but you cannot touch \\nthis and you cannot touch that, I may \\nbe in a position of having to say that \\nthat kind of a constitutional amend-\\nment is unworkable and under those \\ncircumstances I could not support it. \\nBut I want to make it clear that this \\nSenator supports a constitutional \\namendment to balance the budget but \\nnot just any one. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. \\nMr. President, do I still have the \\n\\nfloor? \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from West Virginia has the floor. \\nMr. BYRD. Before the distinguished \\n\\nSenator from Nebraska inquires of the \\ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas \\nwith reference to this matter, may I \\nalso ask the Senator how he would feel \\nabout this proposed language, if the \\nSenator from Arkansas will also in-\\ndulge me. \\n\\nI would ask the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska, does he see anything inher-\\nently objectionable in the following \\nchanges that I would propose: \\n\\n(a) Purpose. The Congress declares that \\nprior to any vote to adopt in the first session \\nof the 104th Congress a joint resolution pro-\\nposing an amendment to the Constitution re-\\nquiring a balanced Federal budget, it is es-\\nsential— \\n\\nThis is paragraph (2).— \\nThat it set forth with specificity in the \\n\\nfirst session— \\n\\nAnd I am picking up the Senator’s \\nlanguage thereon. \\n\\nThis would not declare that it is es-\\nsential that the Congress adopt a con-\\nstitutional amendment on a balanced \\nbudget. I do not think that is essential. \\nSo I am opposed to that. But if we are \\ngoing to have that, then the Senator \\nwould then be saying with his proposal: \\n\\nThe Congress declares that— \\n(1) Prior to any vote to adopt in the first \\n\\nsession of the 104th Congress a joint resolu-\\ntion proposing an amendment to the Con-\\nstitution requiring a balanced budget; \\n\\n(2) It is essential that it set forth with \\nspecificity in the first session of the 104th \\nCongress the policies that achieving such a \\nbalanced Federal budget would require; and \\n\\n(3) Enforce through the congressional \\nbudget process the requirement to achieve a \\nbalanced Federal budget. \\n\\nI do not have any comments on the \\nrest of it at this point. I will have to \\nlook carefully at the remainder of the \\nSenator’s proposal. But I think he is \\nworking on what seems to me to be a \\nvery worthwhile proposal. \\n\\nI have asked the question. \\nMr. EXON. I am glad to respond to \\n\\nmy friend from West Virginia. I will \\ntake all that I have under consider-\\nation. \\n\\nThe Senator makes some good \\npoints. There are some others who may \\nnot be totally enthusiastic about this. \\n\\nBut I do not, again, think that there \\nis any set language or set rules. I just \\nwant to make it clear that this Sen-\\nator has long supported a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the budg-\\net.

I am very much \\ninterested in what his views are on all \\nof this. \\n\\nDid the Senator seek to ask me a \\nquestion or was the Senator seeking \\nthe floor in his own right? \\n\\nMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I still have \\nthe floor. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from West Virginia has the floor. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent \\nthat I may yield to the distinguished \\nSenator from Nebraska for the purpose \\nof his asking those questions. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? Without objection, it is so \\nordered. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. Without my losing the \\nright to the floor. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? Without objection, it is so \\nordered. \\n\\nMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the Sen-\\nator from Arkansas had thought that \\nthe Senator from Nebraska was posing \\na question, and I was rising to answer \\nthat question. I would like to answer, \\nif I may, by saying I think the Senator \\nis certainly moving in the right direc-\\ntion. \\n\\nRight now, on Friday afternoon, be-\\nfore we have really geared up the Sen-\\nate, before we really place our feet and \\nour positions in concrete on whether \\nwe support or reject the idea of a con-\\nstitutional amendment, it is in the \\nspirit of good legislative wisdom and in \\nkeeping with the legislative philosophy \\nof the Senator from Nebraska, I am \\nsure, that this change be made, and if \\nthat change is made, I will enthusiasti-\\ncally—enthusiastically—support the \\nrequirements of specificity that the \\nSenator from Nebraska is addressing in \\nhis amendment. \\n\\nMr. EXON. I thank my friend from \\nArkansas. I will take that under ad-\\nvisement. \\n\\nMr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator. \\nMr. EXON. I thank my friend from \\n\\nWest Virginia for yielding. \\nMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the \\n\\nfloor. \\nMr. SIMON addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Illinois. \\nMr. SIMON. If I may have the atten-\\n\\ntion of my colleague from Nebraska \\nand also the attention of my friend \\nfrom West Virginia, I have no objection \\nto dropping point one because this is \\ncoming down the road. \\n\\nI would have objection to the lan-\\nguage offered by Senator BYRD. Sen-\\nator BYRD and I differ on this, and Sen-\\nator BYRD is obviously trying to put \\nsome language in here where we will \\nend up fighting over how we balance \\nthe budget rather than first estab-\\nlishing the principle. I think it is im-\\nportant that we first establish the \\nprinciple. \\n\\nSo if my colleague from Nebraska \\nwere to accept the Byrd amendment, \\nwith all due respect to the Cicero of \\nthe Senate, I would have to object, I \\nwould have to oppose the Exon amend-\\nment. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for \\njust a brief statement? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield. \\nMr. EXON. I was very interested in \\n\\nhearing the Senator—Cicero, or the \\nSenator from Illinois—because I had \\nanticipated exactly what my colleague \\njust said. He probably would not object \\nto what I suggested originally. But \\nwhen Senator BYRD carried it one step \\nfurther, I saw him rise. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. That is correct. \\nMr. EXON. It is nice, though, that we \\n\\ndo have this kind of consideration. \\nMr. President, to try to bring this \\n\\nmatter to a head, I send a revised \\namendment to the desk which is the re-\\nvised amendment that I first sug-\\ngested. It strikes lines 7, 8, and 9 of the \\namendment. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Illinois still has the floor. \\n\\nMr. EXON. I am sorry. \\nMr. SIMON. If I could just ask one \\n\\nother question on the amendment, be-\\ncause I basically like the thrust of the \\nSenator’s amendment. Suppose that a \\nyear from now or 2 years from now or \\n3 years from now, we come in with a \\nhealth program for the Nation with an \\nincrease in cigarette taxes or some \\nother revenue. This amendment would \\nnot cause us to have 60 votes to pass \\nsuch a package, would it? \\n\\nMr. EXON. It is neutral on that. I \\nthink the Senator knows full well what \\nhappened in the House of Representa-\\ntives the other day. But as of now, it \\nwould be considered as it has tradition-\\nally been considered, a majority vote. \\n\\nHowever, I would simply say that if \\nsomething like that were offered under \\nthe budget rules, a point of order could \\nbe raised if we do not pay for it. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Yes, that is correct. And \\nI agree with that completely. Whatever \\nwe do in the way of spending we have \\nto have the revenue for it. I just want \\nto make sure that we are not locking \\nout some other possibility. \\n\\nMr. EXON. We are not. \\nMr. SIMON. I thank my colleague \\n\\nfrom Nebraska. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Nebraska. \\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I under-\\n\\nstand the leader hopes to speak on this \\namendment very shortly. I understand \\nthat Senator BRADLEY wishes to speak \\non the amendment shortly and is on \\nhis way over. \\n\\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\\nsent that the distinguished leader, Sen-\\nator DASCHLE, be added as original co-\\nsponsor of the amendment. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nAMENDMENT NO. 6, AS MODIFIED \\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I send a \\n\\nmodification to the desk as earlier out-\\nlined. It simply strikes lines 7, 8, and 9. \\nOn line 10 it strikes the number 2 and \\n\\ninserts the number 1. And on line 3, on \\nthe second page, it strikes the number \\n3 and inserts the number 2. \\n\\nI send that modified amendment to \\nthe desk and ask the amendment be so \\nmodified. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator has the right to modify his amend-\\nment. The amendment is so modified. \\n\\nThe amendment (No. 6) as modified is \\nas follows: \\n\\nAt the appropriate place in the bill, insert \\nthe following: \\nSEC. .—CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A \\n\\nBALANCED BUDGET \\n\\n(a) PURPOSE.—The Congress declares it es-\\nsential that the Congress— \\n\\n(1) set forth with specificity in the first \\nsession of the 104th Congress the policies \\nthat achieving such a balanced Federal budg-\\net would require; and \\n\\n(2) enforce through the congressional budg-\\net process the requirement to achieve a bal-\\nanced Federal budget. \\n\\n(b) POINT OF ORDER AGAINST BUDGET RESO-\\nLUTIONS THAT FAIL TO SET FORTH A GLIDE \\nPATH TO A BALANCED BUDGET.—Section 301 of \\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \\namended by inserting at the end thereof the \\nfollowing new subsection: \\n\\n‘‘(j) CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A \\nBALANCED BUDGET.—It shall not be in order \\nto consider any concurrent resolution on the \\nbudget (or amendment, motion, or con-\\nference report thereon) that— \\n\\n‘‘(A) fails to set forth appropriate levels for \\nall items described in subsection (a)(1) \\nthrough (7) for all fiscal years through 2002; \\n\\n‘‘(B) sets forth a level of outlays for fiscal \\nyear 2002 or any subsequent fiscal year that \\nexceeds the level of revenues for that fiscal \\nyear; or \\n\\n‘‘(C) relies on the assumption of either— \\n‘‘(i) reductions in direct spending, or \\n‘‘(ii) increases in revenues, without includ-\\n\\ning specific reconciliation instructions under \\nsection 310 to carry out those assumptions.’’. \\n\\n(c) REQUIREMENT FOR 60 VOTES TO WAIVE OR \\nAPPEAL IN THE SENATE.—Section 904 of the \\nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended \\nby inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘301(i),’’ in both \\nplaces that it appears. \\n\\n(d) SUSPENSION IN THE EVENT OF WAR OR \\nCONGRESSIONALLY-DECLARED LOW GROWTH.— \\nSection 258(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and \\nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is \\namended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘sec-\\ntions’’. \\n\\nMr. EXON.

There appears to be wide-\\nspread support on both sides of the \\naisle on that point. \\n\\nBut we simply cannot afford to wait \\nuntil 2001 to start complying with the \\nbalanced budget amendment. By doing \\nso, we will be adding a far greater bur-\\nden to our national debt, which already \\nis above $4 trillion. \\n\\nIf we pledge our commitment to con-\\ntinued deficit reduction today, we will \\nstill need more than $1 trillion of cuts \\nover the next 7 years to balance the \\nbudget by the year 2002. \\n\\nIf we delay even 1 year, the national \\ndebt will increase by over $150 billion \\nas a result of that delay, and the inter-\\nest on the debt will be approximately \\n$50 billion greater. Each year that we \\ndelay adds another enormous sum to \\nour already-astronomical national \\ndebt, and increase the percentage of \\nour budget that must be dedicated to \\nservicing that debt. \\n\\nIn the last Congress, we passed a def-\\nicit reduction package that will reduce \\nthe budget deficit by nearly $500 bil-\\nlion. Given the magnitude of our exist-\\ning debt, it would be irresponsible and \\nprofoundly illogical not to continue \\nstriving toward a balanced budget this \\nyear, not next year or the year after. \\n\\nTo illustrate the point that Senator \\nEXON and I are trying to make, con-\\nsider the simple situation of a person \\nwho has run up huge amounts of debt \\nat the bank. Does the bank say to that \\nperson, ‘‘You have 7 years to pay off \\nyour debt and, by the way, feel free to \\nincur more debt in the meantime?’’ \\n\\nCertainly not. The bank would insist \\nthat, at a minimum, the debtor not \\nincur further debt. \\n\\nThat is precisely what we are talking \\nabout here, and that is why every \\nMember of this body who supports the \\nbalanced budget amendment should \\nsupport this amendment today. \\n\\nI yield the floor. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Iowa. \\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am \\n\\nnot sure that everybody is aware of \\nwhat we are considering as the under-\\nlying bill in this body. But remember, \\nduring the campaign there was a hue \\nand cry from the grassroots, expressed \\nvery clearly in that election, that peo-\\nple wanted to end the situation where \\nwe had two sets of laws in America, \\none for Capitol Hill and one for the rest \\nof the Nation. \\n\\nIn other words, Congress did not have \\ncertain employment safety laws apply \\nto us that applied to the private sector. \\nThe small business people of America \\nare very up in arms about the fact that \\nthey have to abide by very egregious \\nlegislation, and we who make the laws \\nhave exempted ourselves from that. \\nThat bill passed the House of Rep-\\nresentatives 2 days ago unanimously. \\nSenator DOLE placed the Congressional \\nAccountability Act, which I and Sen-\\n\\nator LIEBERMAN are main sponsors of, \\nas a first bill on the agenda because he \\nwanted to respond to the people at the \\ngrassroots who expressed in that elec-\\ntion the resentment of a dual system of \\nlaw in America. \\n\\nSo that is why that bill is before us. \\nWe had debate on that bill yesterday. \\nSenator GLENN, the Democratic man-\\nager, spoke very eloquently of the rea-\\nsons that legislation ought to pass. \\nSenator LIEBERMAN did, several other \\nDemocrats and several Republicans \\ndid. \\n\\nThere does not seem to be much dis-\\nagreement about what the people said \\nin that election and that S. 2 ought to \\npass the Senate like it has already \\npassed the House. Yet, we are not get-\\nting from there to here very quickly \\nbecause we are dealing with a lot of \\namendments that are unrelated to the \\nbill that the people so clearly ex-\\npressed in the election that we ought \\nto pass and do it very quickly. \\n\\nBy the way, one of the things that \\nthe new majority wants to do is show \\nthe people of this country that it is not \\nbusiness as usual anymore in Wash-\\nington on Capitol Hill passing legisla-\\ntion that they clearly stated they \\nwanted passed and that is on the agen-\\nda of the victor of that election, and we \\nought to get to it and get the job done. \\nThe other body stated that they under-\\nstood that very well with their action \\n2 days ago. Hopefully, we will get that \\ndone in this body very quickly. But we \\nhave dealt with lobbying reform. We \\nhave dealt with campaign finance re-\\nform. We are going to deal with the \\nissue of private use of frequent flyer \\nmileage. We are now dealing with a \\nvery important issue of balancing the \\nbudget. \\n\\nThere is not one of these issues that \\nis being presented by our friends on the \\nother side of the aisle that are not very \\nlegitimate issues to be discussed here. \\nBut every one of these issues will be \\ndiscussed pursuant to the promise of \\nour distinguished leader, Senator \\nDOLE, who said that within just a few \\nweeks we will have lobbying reform \\nand campaign finance reform before \\nthis body. It is already on the majority \\nagenda in both the House and Senate \\nthat we are going to take up a con-\\nstitutional amendment requiring a bal-\\nanced budget. In just 6 weeks we will \\nbe working on the budget resolution \\nthat fits right into what my friend, the \\nSenator from Nebraska, is trying to ac-\\ncomplish this time on this very impor-\\ntant underlying piece of legislation. \\n\\nSo I wish that we could get some sort \\nof understanding that we could deal \\nwith what the people want us to deal \\nwith. The purpose of S. 2 is responding \\nto the mandate of the people in the last \\nelection that we should end the dual \\nsystem of law within this country, one \\nset of law for Congress, and another set \\nof law for the rest of the Nation. But \\nall of this other discussion that is \\ngoing on is preventing us from getting \\nat what we promised the people in the \\nlast election. \\n\\nI do not have a fight with the Sen-\\nator from Nebraska. He has very \\nworthwhile goals on budget issues. In \\nfact, if you remember in the last Con-\\ngress, the only successful effort to \\nchange President Clinton’s budget was \\nthe EXON-GRASSLEY amendment that \\nwas adopted that cut $26 billion from \\nthe President’s budget when it passed \\nthe Senate and $13 billion from the \\ncompromise version that came out of \\nthe conference committee. \\n\\nSo I have worked very closely with \\nSenator EXON in trying to bring a \\nsound fiscal policy to our Federal Gov-\\nernment. I will continue to work with \\nhim for a sound fiscal policy. Why do it \\non legislation that is so easily under-\\nstood by the American people that \\nthey very clearly want? And we are al-\\nmost set to give it to them. The Presi-\\ndent is prepared to sign it. And I just \\nthink we ought to get on with the show \\nand final passage of this legislation and \\nforget about all of this extraneous stuff \\nthat is not unimportant. It is a very \\nimportant issue to be discussing. But \\nthere is a time and place for every-\\nthing, and the time and place is set for \\nall these other issues within just the \\nnext few weeks. We are taking up what \\nought to be No. 1 on everybody’s mind. \\nWe have it up. We ought to pass it. \\n\\nI yield the floor. \\nMr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from New Jersey. \\nMr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the \\n\\ndebate of the Senate on a Friday al-\\nways has a certain unique quality to it. \\nI rise today simply to say to the distin-\\nguished Senator from Nebraska that I \\ndo not know how this issue will be re-\\nsolved. I assume it will be resolved \\ntoday. But I applaud him for raising \\nthe issue and the amendment that he \\nhas offered. \\n\\nThis is really a precursor to a debate \\nwe will have here in the next week on \\nthe balanced budget amendment. It is \\nreally a truth-in-advertising amend-\\nment. It makes explicit what anyone \\nwho supports a balanced budget amend-\\nment should know—which is if you \\nvote for it you have to deliver on it. \\nAnd it makes explicit what delivering \\non it, voting for the balanced budget \\namendment, will cost. \\n\\nI really do not think that there has \\nbeen adequate public focus on what the \\ncost of a balanced budget amendment \\nwill be for average people in this coun-\\ntry, for regions of the country which \\nget a disproportionate share of the \\nFederal dollar or elements of the econ-\\nomy that have heavy subsidies. \\n\\nI think that the public needs to see \\nwhat will be cut if we have to meet a \\nbalanced budget by the year 2002. And I \\nam all for that. \\n\\nIn the last Congress I was on this \\nfloor offering spending cut after spend-\\ning cut on virtually every appropria-\\ntions bill. I am pleased that within the \\nDemocrats I was No. 4 in voting for \\nspending cuts.

What the amendment of \\nthe Senator from Nebraska, as I under-\\nstand it, does is say that after a bal-\\nanced budget amendment passes, if it \\nshould pass, that any budget resolution \\nhas a point of order against it if the \\nbudget resolution did not submit a \\nbudget that reached a balanced budget \\nby the year 2002, which by the way it is \\nprojected will be the year in which the \\ndeficit is $322 billion. \\n\\nSo anyone who supports the balanced \\nbudget amendment would have to sup-\\nport this Exon proposal, because that \\nwould make explicit how we cut $322 \\nbillion by the year 2002. I applaud the \\nSenator very much for his amendment. \\n\\nI know that we will yet have a \\nchance to debate the balanced budget \\namendment. One of the puzzling things \\nfor me with regard to understanding \\nthe support for the balanced budget \\namendment—and maybe the Senator \\nfrom Nebraska is aware of this—is that \\nthere are certain States in the Union \\nthat get a higher return on their tax \\ndollar than other States. Certain \\nStates pay taxes, and get back a lot \\nmore in Federal spending than they \\nhave sent to Washington in taxes. Un-\\nfortunately, my State is not in that \\ngroup because we have a high income. \\nWe pay a high tax, and we send a lot of \\ntax dollars to Washington. We do not \\nget back that many tax dollars relative \\nto what we sent. \\n\\nOnce we get a balanced budget \\namendment, all those States which get \\nback much more than they kick in— \\nand these States are disproportionately \\nin the West—those are the States that \\nwill be disproportionately hit by the \\nneed to dramatically cut spending $322 \\nbillion by the year 2002. And in the \\ncoming debate, I hope that we will be \\nable to focus on these facts. \\n\\nI think the Senator’s amendment is \\nan enormously positive step in getting \\nus to face up to what actually bal-\\nancing the budget will mean. It will \\nnot be easy. There will be no substitute \\nfor cutting spending, and there will be \\nno substitute for Senators coming to \\nthe floor of the U.S. Senate and voting \\nto cut spending, not voting for a proc-\\ness in that 7 or 10 years from now if it \\ngoes into effect, and if there are no ex-\\nclusions or if there are loopholes, will \\nlead to a balanced budget. We need to \\nhave Senators actually coming over \\nhere and voting to cut spending. \\n\\nSo I applaud the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska for his amendment. I know that \\nperhaps he and I have a different view \\non the balanced budget amendment, \\nbut his amendment makes explicit \\nwhat steps must be taken if we are to \\nbalance the budget and requires the \\nCongress to belly up to the wire and \\nsay in 7 years we are going to balance \\nthe budget, and here is how we are \\ngoing to do it—not that in 7 years we \\nwill create some budget glidepath down \\nto a balanced budget in 10 years or 15 \\nyears from now, but in 2002. \\n\\nSo I am anxiously awaiting such a \\ncongressional resolution, because I \\nthink once that congressional resolu-\\ntion is out there and you see how much \\nis going to have to be cut in virtually \\nevery subsidy, virtually every Federal \\nprogram, virtually every entitlement \\nthere for the last 14 years in the Fed-\\neral Government, there will be a mo-\\nment of truth for the Congress and a \\nmoment of truth for those who have \\nvoted for the balanced budget amend-\\nment. \\n\\nI salute the Senator for his amend-\\nment. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my \\nfriend and colleague from the State of \\nNew Jersey very much for his excellent \\nremarks. I think he has indeed hit it \\nright on the head. This is a truth-in-ad-\\nvertising amendment, in addition to a \\ntruth-in-budgeting amendment. And \\nthe Senator made an excellent, right- \\non point as to what this is all about. I \\nhope, therefore, we will have the votes \\nto pass this. We first have to get the 60 \\nvotes to waive. \\n\\nI also thank my friend and colleague \\nfrom Iowa. Senator GRASSLEY and my-\\nself have worked together on many \\nthings over the years, and we will be \\nworking on things in the future. I sim-\\nply say to my friend from Iowa that I \\nwas very pleased with the fact that he \\nmentioned once again what few know— \\nthat the only reductions made in the \\nbudget last year were the Exon-Grass-\\nley amendments that he and I fash-\\nioned and worked through the Con-\\ngress. \\n\\nWhat I am doing in this particular \\ncase, as the Senator has clearly indi-\\ncated, is to apply to Congress what we \\napply to others—And if Congress wants \\nto have a balanced budget amendment, \\nwhich I hope they do, then they should \\nlive up to it. You had indicated in your \\nremarks that while you thought the \\nExon amendment was probably a good \\none, this is the wrong place to put it. \\nWell, I suggest that this is the right \\nplace to put it. What we are talking \\nabout here today is to make Congress \\nlive up to the laws that it applies to \\nthe people of the United States. If we \\nare going to have a constitutional \\namendment to balance the budget, \\nthen that has to apply to the Congress. \\nSo I think it is very appropriate that \\nthis measure be passed on the bill, the \\nunderlying bill before us, which I indi-\\ncated in my opening remarks I strong-\\nly support. \\n\\nNow, it is not the intention of this \\nSenator to delay at all the institution \\nof the measure that is going to receive \\noverwhelming support. \\n\\nMr. DORGAN. If the Senator will \\nyield—— \\n\\nMr. EXON. I am prepared to come to \\na vote in a relatively short period of \\ntime. I do not want to be accused of \\nholding up anything. \\n\\nI think it is important enough that it \\nshould go on this legislation. I do not \\nthink there is any piece of legislation \\nwe are likely to pass this year that is \\ngoing to be more important than a con-\\n\\nstitutional amendment to balance the \\nbudget, which 80 percent of the people \\nin the United States of America want. \\nI want to get on with that. I do not \\nhappen to buy the reason or excuse, de-\\npending on your point of view, as to \\nwhy it should not be an amendment to \\nthe measure before us. \\n\\nMr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Sen-\\nator will yield for a question. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Yes, I am happy to yield \\nto the Senator for a question. \\n\\nMr. DORGAN. I have listened to \\nsome of the debate on this issue, and I \\nhave heard some say, Gee, I do not nec-\\nessarily oppose what you are trying to \\ndo, but maybe this is not the place or \\ntime to do it. That is always an inter-\\nesting discussion. I understand that \\none can make a stronger or weaker \\ncase against doing something like this \\non one bill or another. But the fact is \\nthat the ultimate—it seems to me that \\nthe ultimate rule and the ultimate cir-\\ncumstance, which is that we ought to \\nlive the way everybody else does in this \\ncountry, would be to have a budget \\nprocess that says when you come here \\nwith a budget, let us, if we are going to \\npass a constitutional amendment—and \\nI think we will—to balance the budget, \\nand let us require the budget document \\nitself to get us to that point. \\n\\nIn other words, if you bring a road \\nmap to the floor of the Senate that is \\npurported to be the budget but never \\ngets to the destination, of what value \\nis the map? And the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska, who I think has been one of the \\nmost consistent voices on this subject \\nover the years, I think, does a service \\nby raising the question. I assume if the \\nSenator from Nebraska loses the vote \\nhere because some people say, Gee, this \\nis a great idea but the wrong place, I \\nassume we will see it again. I hope we \\nsee it again. \\n\\nI fully intend to vote for it, because \\nI do not think this is a question of \\nwhat place you put this in the process. \\nThe question is whether this makes \\nsense in the context of what we are \\nabout to embark on this year as a \\nbody. The answer clearly is yes. It \\nmakes perfect sense, and it makes per-\\nfect sense to do now, this minute. I \\nwanted to state that the Senator has \\ndone a service, I think, by offering this. \\n\\nI hope my colleagues will look at the \\nmerits of this and say: Gee, this makes \\na lot of sense. If we are going to put \\nout a budget map here, let us have a \\ndestination on the map that gets us to \\nwhat all the American people want— \\nthat is, a balanced budget. \\n\\nI will frame it in a question. As I \\nhave understood the debate, is it the \\nunderstanding of the Senator from Ne-\\nbraska that there seems to be a fair \\namount, at least, of sympathy with \\nthis amendment, but some are saying, \\nGee maybe we cannot vote for it be-\\ncause it is the wrong time? Will the \\nSenator once again explain, is there a \\nbetter time anywhere he knows of than \\nto pass this at this moment? \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S555 January 6, 1995 \\n(Mr. THOMAS assumed the Chair.) \\nMr. EXON. In answer to my friend \\n\\nfrom North Dakota, I do not know of a \\nbetter time or a more appropriate \\ntime, as I have said. Since we are talk-\\ning about making laws that we apply \\nto others apply to ourselves, what \\nmore important law is there than a \\nconstitutional amendment? \\n\\nI simply say that I thank my friend \\nfrom North Dakota for his kind re-\\nmarks. I must say to him that this \\nSenator was somewhat surprised to \\nfind opposition to this amendment, be-\\ncause I felt that this amendment would \\npass overwhelmingly since we had al-\\nmost two-thirds of the Senate vote for \\na constitutional amendment to balance \\nthe budget last year. Then I heard \\nabout the fact that there may be a \\npoint of order raised against the \\namendment, since it was not particu-\\nlarly germane, as the rules of the Sen-\\nate so indicate, so therefore I moved to \\nwaive that. We have to have 60 votes \\nnow to even have an up-or-down vote \\non the Exon amendment. I was quite \\nsurprised because I thought the opposi-\\ntion to the Exon amendment would \\ncome from the relatively few Members \\nof the U.S. Senate that traditionally \\nhave stood against passing a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the budg-\\net. \\n\\nAnd there are some legitimate rea-\\nsons that those people have, and very \\nwell thought of Members of this Sen-\\nate. I do not suppose there is a better \\nconstitutional lawyer in this body than \\nSenator BYRD of West Virginia. He is \\nfundamentally opposed to a constitu-\\ntional amendment to balance the Fed-\\neral budget. He has pointed out in sev-\\neral speeches that I have heard him \\ngive that, while it is true that you \\nhave this in some of the States, it does \\nnot and should not apply in the Con-\\ngress of the United States. \\n\\nTo answer the Senator’s question, I \\nam somewhat mystified at the opposi-\\ntion that has arisen to this, since I \\nthought two-thirds of the people were \\nfor a constitutional amendment to bal-\\nance the budget. I am, therefore, very \\nconcerned about the fact, I must tell \\nmy friend from North Dakota, that \\npossibly some of our colleagues are for \\nthe constitutional amendment to bal-\\nance the budget but do not want to \\nspell out the hard choices that are \\ngoing to have to be made. \\n\\nSo I will simply say, in answer to an-\\nother question that the Senator from \\nNorth Dakota raised, if the Exon \\namendment is defeated in any fashion \\non this particular measure, I assure my \\nfriend from North Dakota that it will, \\nin the words of Franklin Delano Roo-\\nsevelt, come up again and again and \\nagain. So there will be chances for peo-\\nple to vote on this again if it fails \\ntoday. \\n\\nMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I \\nmight ask the Senator from Nebraska \\nto yield one more moment, just for one \\nadditional question. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Yes. \\nMr. DORGAN. The prospect here of \\n\\nvoting today and deciding not to sup-\\n\\nport this, as the Senator has said, will \\nproduce this same amendment in the \\nfuture. I am pleased to hear him say \\nthat. \\n\\nI think all of us probably agree that \\na balanced budget—that is, a zero bal-\\nance—is not necessarily nirvana some-\\nwhere out there. \\n\\nI did not used to think we should \\nchange the Constitution to do this, as a \\nmatter of fact. But year after year \\nafter year of a budget that is fun-\\ndamentally out of balance with respect \\nto operating budget deficits, that can-\\nnot continue. That hurts this country. \\nAnd I decided some years ago, gee, I \\nmean, we do not have much choice. \\n\\nBut we could change the Constitu-\\ntion at 2:15, 3 minutes from now, and it \\nwill do nothing, nothing, to balance \\nthe budget. We will simply have \\nchanged the Constitution to require a \\nbalanced budget, and then others will \\nhave to find ways to achieve those \\nends. \\n\\nI must also say to you that I would \\nnot care at all if we had a budget def-\\nicit that was $300 billion this year if \\nthat budget deficit, by its expenditure, \\nhad cured cancer, as an example. Spend \\n$300 billion you do not have and cure \\ncancer. Is that a good investment? \\nYour darn right it is a good invest-\\nment. It would not bother me a bit. \\n\\nBut the billions of dollars, hundreds \\nof billions of dollars, that we are now \\nspending that we do not have are not \\ninvestments. They are operating budg-\\net deficits, year after year, that cannot \\ncontinue. If this were an investment, it \\nwould be one thing. But it is not an in-\\nvestment, it is the operating budget. \\nAnd it is, in my judgment, impeding \\nthis country’s economy and oppor-\\ntunity. \\n\\nSo that is why I support what the \\nSenator is doing. I hope, Mr. President, \\nthe Senator will prevail today. If not, I \\nhope the Senator will tell us how soon \\nhe will be back to give us the oppor-\\ntunity to do this once again. \\n\\nMr. EXON. I thank my friend from \\nNorth Dakota. \\n\\nLet me say, in probably closing de-\\nbate, since I am ready to vote on this \\nat the pleasure of the majority leader, \\nthe Senator is certainly right. The bal-\\nanced budget amendment does not in \\nand of itself balance a budget. And that \\nneeds to be said time and time again. \\nWe will need, sooner or later, an \\namendment just like mine if we are \\never going to balance the budget. \\n\\nWhen the Senator was talking \\nabout—and I thought he made an excel-\\nlent point—if we had a $200 or $300 bil-\\nlion deficit and we had cured cancer as \\na result of it, I think we would all vote \\nfor it. But the deficit has become a way \\nof life, unfortunately. \\n\\nNot only is the budget deficit some-\\nthing that we talk about—and I think \\nwe should have possibly a better under-\\nstanding by the American people of \\nthis addition to the problem of the an-\\nnual deficits in the billions of dollars; \\nthat is only part of the problem. The \\nreal problem is, at the end of each and \\n\\nevery fiscal year, we take whatever the \\ndeficit is and we get rid of it. It goes \\naway. Where does it go? On the na-\\ntional debt. \\n\\nI find many times that many people \\nsimply have not taken the time to ad-\\ndress the fact that they hear about bil-\\nlions and billions of dollars, between a \\n$100 billion and a $350 billion deficit, \\nand that is only for 1 year. All of that, \\nof course, goes on to the national debt \\nat the end of every fiscal year. \\n\\nSo we not only have the annual def-\\nicit to worry about, we have the abso-\\nlutely skyrocketing national debt of \\nthe United States that, of course, is \\nthe accumulation of all the deficits \\nover the years. \\n\\nAt the present time, that national \\ndebt stands at $4.7 trillion. Interest \\nalone on the national debt that, once \\nagain, is the accumulation of the an-\\nnual fiscal year deficits, is the fastest \\ngrowing part of the debt—not welfare, \\nnot food stamps, not even national de-\\nfense. The fastest growing part of the \\ndrain on your tax dollars is interest on \\nthe national debt. \\n\\nI thought the President explained it \\npretty well recently in a speech when \\nhe said that very shortly, when you \\npay your income taxes in April 1995, 28 \\ncents—28 cents—of every dollar that is \\npaid in taxes by the American people \\nnext April 15 goes directly to pay inter-\\nest on the national debt which, of \\ncourse, is the accumulation of the an-\\nnual deficits. I wonder how many \\nAmericans fully understand that. \\n\\nNot only is that a serious problem, \\nbut I say to you that as far as we can \\nsee into the future—and even the pro-\\njections into the future by the year \\n2002, where we are going to have annual \\ndeficits in the $200 billion to $350 bil-\\nlion range annually—that national \\ndebt that is already at $4.7 trillion is \\nclearly going to go up at the rate of \\n$200 to $300 to $350 billion a year, if and \\nwhen we pass the constitutional \\namendment to balance the budget, and \\nif and when we ever line up how we are \\ngoing to reach that by the 2002 date. \\n\\nAnother way of saying that is under \\nthe best scenario, the most optimistic \\nscenario, we are going to see the na-\\ntional debt go from $4.7 to $6 or $7 tril-\\nlion while we are twiddling our thumbs \\nhere and debating whether or not an \\namendment to put teeth in the bal-\\nanced budget amendment is germane \\non a bill before the U.S. Senate. \\n\\nIt does not make any sense to me. I \\ndo not think it will make any sense to \\nthe American people when they under-\\nstand it. \\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \\nMr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

If not, without objection, it \\nis so ordered. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I \\nsuggest the absence of a quorum, and I \\nask that the time be equally divided. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nThe clerk will call the roll. \\nThe legislative clerk proceeded to \\n\\ncall the roll. \\nMr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask \\n\\nunanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the \\nSenator from North Dakota whatever \\ntime he desires. \\n\\nMr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank \\nthe Senator from Nebraska. \\n\\nI have come to the floor to commend \\nthe Senator for what I think is an ex-\\ncellent amendment, precisely the kind \\nof amendment we ought to consider \\nand we ought to support today. Mr. \\nPresident, the Senator from Nebraska \\nhas offered an amendment which says \\nsimply and clearly and powerfully, that \\nif we are going to pass a balanced budg-\\net amendment to the Constitution, \\nsomething that I support, that we \\nought to match our words and our \\ndeeds. \\n\\nThat is precisely what the Senator \\nfrom Nebraska has put before this \\nbody. Mr. President, that is what the \\nunderlying legislation is all about. \\nMatching words with deeds. Holding \\nCongress accountable. Having Congress \\nfollow the laws that it writes. Nothing \\ncould be more important with respect \\nto a balanced budget amendment to the \\nConstitution than that we actually \\nstart to write a balanced budget. Not \\njust pass a balanced budget amendment \\nto the Constitution, and then do the \\nsame old thing and not start to actu-\\nally balance the budget. The easiest \\nthing in the world is to pass a balanced \\nbudget amendment to the Constitution \\nand then do nothing to start balancing \\nthe budget. I cannot think of anything \\nthat would be more destructive of pub-\\nlic trust than to engage in that kind of \\ncruel public hoax. That is precisely \\nwhat could happen here. \\n\\nWe all know what is politically easy \\nand what is politically hard. What is \\npolitically easy is to stand up and say \\n‘‘I’m for a balanced budget;’’ what is \\npolitically hard is to actually do the \\nwork of balancing the budget. That is \\nwhat is challenging. That is what is \\ndifficult. That is what is politically \\nhard to do. \\n\\nThe Senator from Nebraska says \\n‘‘Yes, let’s have a balanced budget \\namendment; but beyond that, let’s ac-\\n\\ntually start to balance the budget.’’ \\nWhat a novel idea. Mr. President, it is \\nprecisely what we ought to do. That is \\nexactly what we ought to do. I cannot \\nthink of anything that would give this \\ncountry more confidence in what we \\nare doing than that. \\n\\nNow, Mr. President, one of the things \\nI am concerned about as I watch this \\ndebate is we talk about balancing the \\nbudget, but we rarely talk about why \\nwe should balance the budget. It is not \\njust because it makes us feel good. It is \\nnot just because you should match \\nwhat you spend with what you take in. \\nIt is because balancing the budget has \\nreal economic consequences that are \\npositive for this country. It makes a \\ndifference in the lives of people. \\n\\nMr. President, we got the evidence \\ntoday of a package we passed 2 years \\nago doing something positive in the \\nlives of people. Just today we received \\nnews of what has happened with the \\nunemployment rate in this country. It \\nhas dropped to 5.4 percent, the lowest \\nlevel in 4 years, and 3.5 million jobs \\nwere created in this country. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The time \\nof the Senator has expired. The re-\\nmaining 3 minutes belongs to the Sen-\\nator from Iowa. \\n\\nMr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask \\nunanimous consent that we might ex-\\ntend the time by 10 minutes, to be \\nequally divided. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I \\nwould yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \\nfrom North Dakota. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield \\nwhatever time is remaining to me to \\nmy colleague from North Dakota. \\n\\nMr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank \\nthe Senator from Nebraska. \\n\\nAs I was pointing out, 3.5 million jobs \\nwere created in 1994—3.5 million. I be-\\nlieve one of the key reasons is that a \\nnumber of us had the courage to vote \\nfor a budget package 2 years ago that \\nreduced the deficit by over $500 billion \\nover the next 5 years. Because we did \\nthat, because we cut spending, and, \\nyes, raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 \\npercent among us, the result was a re-\\nduced deficit. The result of that was re-\\nduced interest rates. The result of that \\nwas renewed economic growth in this \\ncountry, increased job creation, and a \\nmuch stronger economy. \\n\\nThat is why we need to move toward \\na balanced budget, because it will take \\npressure off of interest rates. It will \\nallow this economy to continue to \\ngrow. It will allow this country to get \\nback on track. That is why the amend-\\nment of the Senator from Nebraska is \\nso important. \\n\\nMr. President, I thank, again, the \\nSenator from Nebraska. \\n\\nI yield the floor. \\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how \\n\\nmuch time is remaining on both sides? \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and \\n\\none-half minutes for the Senator from \\nIowa and 1 minute and 14 seconds for \\nthe Senator from Nebraska \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I \\nyield back the remaining time on this \\nside. \\n\\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield \\nback the time remaining on this side. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE. \\n(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— \\n(1) Bridgestone/Firestone, a subsidiary of \\n\\nforeign owned Bridgestone Corp., has re-\\ncently announced its decision to hire perma-\\nnent replacement workers displacing more \\nthan 2,000 American workers; \\n\\n(2) this action may result in the largest \\npermanent displacement of workers in over a \\ndecade: \\n\\n(3) the practice of hiring permanent re-\\nplacement workers is devastating, not only \\nto the replaced workers, but also to their \\nfamilies and communities; \\n\\n(4) the position of management of foreign \\nowned Bridgestone/Firestone appears to be \\nthat they cannot compete with their Amer-\\nican owned competitor, Goodyear, if they \\nprovide wages, benefits, and conditions of \\nemployment benefits patterned after those \\nprovided by Goodyear; \\n\\n(5) hiring permanent replacement workers \\nis illegal under the laws of the parent com-\\npany’s own country; and \\n\\n(6) most of the United States’ major trad-\\ning partners, including Japan, Germany, \\nFrance, and Canada, recognize that using \\npermanent replacements is bad business and \\nbad public policy. \\n\\n(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense \\nof the Senate that— \\n\\n(1) Bridgestone/Firestone should reconsider \\nits decision to hire permanent replacement \\nworkers and return to the bargaining table \\nand bargain in good faith with the United \\nRubberworkers of America, the representa-\\ntive of their employees; and \\n\\n(2) the Clinton Administration, working \\nthrough the appropriate diplomatic channels \\nand using the appropriate trade negotia-\\ntions, should impress upon the parent com-\\npany’s home government the concern of the \\nUnited States over this matter and seek \\ntheir assistance in getting Bridgestone/Fire-\\nstone to reconsider their decision. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer \\nthis amendment on behalf of Senator \\nGLENN, Senator HARKIN, Senator \\nMOSELEY-BRAUN, Senator FEINGOLD, \\nand myself. And I believe I am willing \\nto enter into a time agreement on that. \\nI am checking with Senator DASCHLE \\non my side on the time agreement and \\nI should know that very shortly. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? \\nMr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield. \\nMr. BYRD. Before we will be able to \\n\\nenter into a time agreement, some of \\nus would like to know what the amend-\\nment does. We did not let the clerk \\nread it. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. I did not let the clerk \\nread it but I will be happy to explain \\nthe amendment. \\n\\nMr. BYRD. May I hear that before we \\nare asked to enter into an agreement? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is a \\nsense-of-the-Senate resolution regard-\\ning a strike situation that we face in \\nthis country. Bridgestone/Firestone is \\na company wholly owned by a Japanese \\ncorporation. They bought Firestone, \\nmerged the two companies. They have \\nhad a strike on since July. And back, I \\nguess about a month ago, Senator \\nGLENN and Senator HARKIN and Sen-\\nator MOSELEY-BRAUN and several of us \\nmet with the Japanese Ambassador and \\nurged that they negotiate, that they \\nsit down and negotiate. \\n\\nI, frankly, do not know, in terms of \\nthe dispute between labor and manage-\\nment, which side is right. What I do \\nknow is that they ought to sit down \\nand negotiate. But the Bridgestone/ \\nFirestone has announced they are \\ngoing to fire all the strikers and per-\\nmanently replace them. That is—I have \\nbeen doing some checking—we have \\nhad only two precedents like that since \\nthe 1930’s. We have had no striker re-\\nplacement law, as Western Europe and \\nCanada and the other countries do, but \\nwe have had a tradition that you do \\nnot do that. And this resolution simply \\nsays to the corporation: Sit down and \\nnegotiate, rather than just firing sev-\\neral thousand workers. \\n\\nI would hope that we could adopt this \\nresolution. My friend from Iowa indi-\\ncates that he has some concerns, other-\\nwise we could adopt it by voice vote. \\nThat is basically the situation. \\n\\nLet me point out one other thing. \\nThis is a Japanese—wholly-owned Jap-\\nanese firm now. In Japan it would be il-\\nlegal for them to do what they are \\ndoing in Illinois, in Iowa, in Oklahoma, \\nOhio, and Indiana. My hope is that this \\n\\nsense-of-the-Senate resolution could be \\nadopted and that we can move forward. \\nI yield the floor. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Illinois. \\n\\nMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. Presi-\\ndent, I rise in strong support of the \\nsense-of-the-Senate amendment of my \\ncolleague, the senior Senator from Illi-\\nnois, [Mr. SIMON], and to give some \\nbackground on this issue. It is some-\\nthing that has troubled us greatly and \\nthat I believe is a matter that really \\nboils down to good corporate citizen-\\nship. \\n\\nMr. President, some 4,000 members of \\nthe United Rubber Workers, including \\n1,250 members of local 713 in Decatur, \\nIL, have been exercising their right to \\nstrike against the Bridgestone/Fire-\\nstone company which is, as Senator \\nSIMON indicated, a foreign-owned cor-\\nporation. The strike began when, after \\nmonths of negotiations, the company \\nrefused to accept a contract that was \\nsimilar to the contract the United Rub-\\nber Workers had negotiated with Good-\\nyear, which is an American company. \\nThroughout the duration of the strike \\nthe United Rubber Workers have main-\\ntained a willingness to bargain with \\nBridgestone/Firestone to attempt to re-\\nsolve their differences. In fact, earlier \\nthis week the URW bargaining com-\\nmittee notified Bridgestone/Firestone \\nthat it would be meeting with Federal \\nmediators in an effort to resume bar-\\ngaining and to end the work stoppage. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the company has not \\nshown the same willingness to nego-\\ntiate in good faith. In fact, some 2 days \\nago the company informed its workers \\nthat they will be permanently replaced \\nas a result of this ongoing dispute. A \\nnumber of Senators and I, whose work-\\ners are affected by this strike, have \\ndone everything we can, everything \\npossible, to try to help resolve this dis-\\npute. In fact, just this afternoon I \\ncalled on and had a conversation with \\nsome of our trade negotiators, to see to \\nit that these kinds of issues of the con-\\nduct, the corporate citizenship of for-\\neign companies doing business here in \\nAmerica, was an issue that would be \\nbrought up in their trade discussions \\nand negotiations in future times. We \\nwill see how that plays out. \\n\\nBut the point is, without giving a \\nlong speech about this because I under-\\nstand there are others who want to \\nspeak to this issue, this company is \\ndoing to American workers what Amer-\\nican companies cannot do, or have not \\ndone, to American workers, by and \\nlarge. Senator SIMON has discovered \\none tiny precedent of similarity in one \\ninstance. But by and large, in this in-\\ndustry, what is going on here is quite \\nextraordinary. While on the one hand \\nwe do not want to get in a situation in \\nwhich investment by foreign companies \\nis discouraged—we want to encourage \\ninvestment, we want to encourage par-\\nticipation—we certainly want to en-\\ncourage positive relations with our \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES558 January 6, 1995 \\ncompanies from whatever part of the \\nworld they may come, the fact is that \\nwhen one is doing business here in the \\nUnited States it is only appropriate \\nand only a function of good corporate \\ncitizenship that one does business in \\nkeeping with the values and the tradi-\\ntion and the fair play that American \\nworkers, I think, have every right to \\nexpect. \\n\\nWe do not have a striker replacement \\nlaw in this country but we know for a \\nfact it is against the law to fire a work-\\ner for exercising the right to strike. It \\nis not against the law to permanently \\nreplace that worker. But at the same \\ntime, to have permanent replacement \\nresorted to as a measure by corporate \\nleadership in an instance in which it \\nwould not happen if it were an Amer-\\nican company, or has not happened in \\ncertain similarly situated American \\ncompanies, sours the atmosphere and \\nsets an unfortunate precedent that I \\nhope the leadership of Bridgestone/ \\nFirestone would take a good hard look \\nat and reconsider. \\n\\nMr. President, with that I encourage \\nmy colleagues to support this sense-of- \\nthe-Senate resolution and I yield the \\nfloor. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Ohio. \\n\\nMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to \\nsupport the actions being taken by \\nSenator SIMON. It is a sense-of-the-Sen-\\nate resolution. Certainly we would not \\nbe willing to vote today to do exactly \\nthe opposite and to say no, we do not \\nthink there should be any more nego-\\ntiations; no, we think it should be \\nfinal. Even Japanese law, it was point-\\ned out here, in the home country of \\nJapan—this is a wholly-owned Japa-\\nnese corporation now—but the law in \\nJapan would prevent them from doing \\nexactly what we are doing here, even \\nthough we have yet to put into place \\nany striker replacement legislation in \\nthis country. \\n\\nSo surely we do not go the opposite \\ntack and say, ‘‘No. We don’t think \\nthere should be any more negotiation.’’ \\nWe do quite the opposite. We say, \\n‘‘Look, it is never too late.’’ And while \\nwe cannot take sides in this as U.S. \\nSenators and come down on exactly \\nwhat the final solution would be, sure-\\nly it is within our responsibility to our \\npeople in our respective States and this \\ncountry to say, ‘‘Look, don’t just give \\nup on this thing. At least sit down and \\ntalk about it some more.’’ I know it \\nhas been a long discussion. They have \\nhad long negotiations. But sometimes \\njust when things look the blackest in \\nthe negotiation is when real progress \\ncan be made. \\n\\nI hope this is not just a negotiating \\nploy. I do not think it is. I think \\nBridgestone/Firestone is serious about \\nthis, and that makes it all the more in-\\ncumbent upon us to take some action \\nhere on the Senate floor. \\n\\nSo I had real hope after we met with \\nthe Japanese Ambassador that he was \\ngoing to use his good offices to do ev-\\nerything he possibly could. Perhaps he \\n\\ndid. I certainly will not say that he did \\nnot do everything that he could pos-\\nsibly do. But what we are saying is, in \\nthe interest of fairness to our workers \\nand in the interest of even the com-\\npany adhering to what the Japanese \\nlaw is, sit down again and let us see if \\nwe cannot work this thing out before \\nwe go through the throes of seeing \\nsome 2,000-plus American workers \\nbeing tossed out permanently. I think \\nthat would be too bad. \\n\\nI want to compliment Senator SIMON \\nfor taking the lead on this and am glad \\nto support his sense-of-the-Senate reso-\\nlution. \\n\\nMr. SIMON addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. \\n\\nKYL). The Senator from Illinois. \\nMr. SIMON. I thank Senator GLENN. \\nMr. President, let me just add one \\n\\nother point. In addition to the labor- \\nmanagement factor here, I think the \\nother factor is United States-Japan re-\\nlations. This is not the kind of thing \\nthat is going to help relations between \\nour two countries. \\n\\nSo I hope that, if we adopt this reso-\\nlution—and I hope we do—that the cor-\\nporation would take another look at \\nthis. This is not good for United \\nStates-Japan relations as well as not \\ngood for the future of this corporation, \\nBridgestone/Firestone. The rubber \\nworkers have taken the position they \\nshould have the same contract as they \\ndo with the Firestone competitor, \\nGoodyear. I do not know whether they \\nare right or wrong. That is not the \\npoint. All we say is sit down and nego-\\ntiate and see if this can be worked out. \\n\\nMr. President, if no one else seeks \\nthe floor, I question the presence of a \\nquorum. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\nclerk will call the roll. \\n\\nThe bill clerk proceeded to call the \\nroll. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask \\nunanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nORDER OF PROCEDURE \\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask \\n\\nunanimous consent that the time prior \\nto a motion to table the Simon amend-\\nment be as follows: 5 minutes under the \\ncontrol of myself, 20 minutes under the \\ncontrol of Senator SIMON; and, further, \\nat the conclusion or yielding back of \\ntime, the majority leader or his des-\\nignee be recognized to make a motion \\nto table the Simon amendment. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? Without objection, it is so \\nordered. \\n\\nWho yields time? \\nMr. SIMON. I say to my colleague \\n\\nfrom Iowa, if he is going to yield his \\ntime, I am willing to yield my time and \\nproceed to a vote. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Except for Senator \\nKASSEBAUM to speak a few moments, as \\nshe put it, we will do that. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. I always welcome Sen-\\nator KASSEBAUM’s speech. \\n\\nMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I \\nyield such time as she might consume \\n\\nto the distinguished Senator from Kan-\\nsas, NANCY KASSEBAUM. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Kansas [Mrs. KASSEBAUM], is \\nrecognized. \\n\\nMrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I \\nappreciate that. I appreciate the cour-\\ntesy of the Senator from Illinois as \\nwell. As he knows, I have some strong \\nviews on this issue that I would like to \\nexpress. I can certainly appreciate the \\npoints of view of the Senators from Illi-\\nnois, Senators MOSELEY-BRAUN and \\nSIMON. But I have to rise in strong op-\\nposition to the resolution that has \\nbeen offered by the Senator from Illi-\\nnois. \\n\\nMr. President, I rise today in opposi-\\ntion to the resolution offered by the \\nSenator from Illinois. The Senator’s \\nresolution expresses the sense of the \\nSenate that Bridgestone/Firestone Tire \\nCo. should not use permanent replace-\\nments for workers on strike in a labor \\ndispute in Ohio, Oklahoma, Indiana, \\nand Illinois. \\n\\nMr. President, we have been through \\nthis argument on the floor, and it is \\nwell understood by most everyone here. \\n\\nThe Congressional Accountability \\nAct passed the House of Representa-\\ntives on a unanimous vote 2 days ago, \\nand now we are here on a late Friday \\nafternoon with a sense-of-the-Senate \\nresolution on an enormously important \\nissue that does not relate in any way to \\nthe Congressional Accountability Act. \\n\\nI know the Senator from Illinois is \\nwell-intentioned. But this is neither \\nthe time nor the place for Congress to \\nbe considering anything other than \\nthis very important bill which is before \\nus—the Congressional Accountability \\nAct. \\n\\nThe amendment offered by the Sen-\\nator from Illinois is completely extra-\\nneous from the matter at hand, and for \\nthat reason alone I believe the Senate \\nshould table his amendment. \\n\\nNot only is the amendment inappro-\\npriate and untimely, but it is also \\nwrong on the substance as well. \\n\\nJust for a moment, if I may reiterate \\nwhat we have talked about before in \\nthe debate on this issue, Congress \\nshould not take sides in a private labor \\ndispute as this amendment clearly \\ndoes. We should not take sides in a pri-\\nvate dispute. \\n\\nBecause we have many new Members \\nin this body, I think it might be helpful \\nto provide a brief background on our \\nFederal labor laws. It has been estab-\\nlished Federal labor law for over 50 \\nyears that labor has the right to strike, \\nand companies have the right to con-\\ntinue operating during the strike. On \\nrare occasions, this may require hiring \\npermanent replacements. \\n\\nThese competing rights, and the \\nrisks they entail, enable the parties to \\nsettle the overwhelming number of \\nlabor disputes at the bargaining table \\nwhich is the way I believe strongly \\nthey should be resolved. \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S559 January 6, 1995 \\nWithout the ability to hire perma-\\n\\nnent replacements, labor could strike \\nat any time, for any reason, without \\nany risk. It really disrupts completely. \\nI would argue that the balance is a dif-\\nficult one, but I think a fair balance. \\n\\nThe compelling nature of these argu-\\nments led the Senate to defeat legisla-\\ntion—S. 55—during both the 102d and \\n103d Congress. S. 55 would have prohib-\\nited employers from hiring permanent \\nreplacements during an economic \\nstrike. So the law is clear the employ-\\ners may hire permanent replacements \\nduring economic strikes. \\n\\nMr. President, Congress established \\nthe private collective bargaining sys-\\ntem to facilitate the peaceful resolu-\\ntion of labor disputes. We leave it to \\nthe parties to decide for themselves \\nwhat a fair deal is. \\n\\nAs difficult as it may be—and each of \\nus has had these disputes in our own \\nStates and we wish we could do some-\\nthing that could bring it to a resolu-\\ntion, but as sure as we start down that \\npath, we will all regret it and all the \\nparties to those labor disputes will re-\\ngret it as well. \\n\\nIt is not for this body to decide \\nwhether Bridgestone is justified in hir-\\ning permanent replacements during the \\ncourse of their current labor dispute. \\nWe are not the arbiters of labor dis-\\nputes in the U.S. Senate, and we do not \\njudge the fairness of any of the terms \\nof a particular labor agreement. \\n\\nMr. President, it is improper for the \\nSenate to single out one company and \\nattempt to influence a private labor \\ndispute. Regardless of the merits on ei-\\nther side, we do not negotiate collec-\\ntive bargaining agreements in the Sen-\\nate. There is a good reason for this. \\n\\nWe would be establishing a dangerous \\nprecedent if we approved this sense-of- \\nthe-Senate resolution, because we \\nwould be opening ourselves up to de-\\nbating the merits of very single labor \\ndisputes. In fact, we would see a virtual \\nparade of labor and management \\ngroups coming to Capitol Hill seeking \\nto gain a bargaining advantage \\nthrough congressional action. We do \\nnot want to start that kind of prece-\\ndent. \\n\\nMr. President, I am also perplexed by \\nthe language in the resolution that \\ncompares the laws of the United States \\nand Japan. The resolution seems to \\nsuggest that there is something wrong \\nwith Bridgestone, a Japanese-owned \\ncompany, following the laws of the \\nUnited States, because using perma-\\nnent replacements would be illegal in \\nJapan. \\n\\nCompanies doing business in the \\nUnited States are supposed to follow \\nour laws. We demand that they follow \\nour laws, whether they are owned by \\nthe Japanese or by Americans. So the \\nfact that Japanese law does not allow \\npermanent replacements is totally ir-\\nrelevant. \\n\\nThe irony, of course, is that often we \\ncomplain that American companies ex-\\nport jobs overseas. In this case, a Japa-\\nnese company bought an American \\n\\ncompany—Firestone—and invested bil-\\nlions of dollars in an American com-\\npany to make it financially viable. I \\nthink we want to encourage that kind \\nof investment. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me \\nsay in response to my colleague from \\nKansas, that we are not passing the law \\non striker replacement. This is simply \\na sense of the Senate stating they \\nought to sit down and work these \\nthings out. We do have traditions of \\nnot hiring permanent replacements for \\nstrikers. And as far as interfering in a \\nlabor-management situation, we have \\npassed a lot of resolutions on these, in-\\ncluding specific legislation. This is not \\nlegislation. We have, on at least three \\noccasions that I know of, passed legis-\\nlation dictating what is going to hap-\\npen in railroad strikes, since I have \\nbeen in the Senate. And since my col-\\nleague from Kansas has been here \\nlonger, she has probably voted for more \\nthan three of these. \\n\\nThis is only a sense-of-the-Senate \\nresolution urging the two parties to sit \\ndown and work things out. We do not \\ntake sides. We do not say one side is \\nright and one side is wrong. We do say \\nthat firing these thousands of workers \\nwho are on strike is not the direction \\nwe think they should go. I have partici-\\npated in the striker replacement legis-\\nlation, and I think everyone here on \\nthe floor said we do not think this is \\nthe way people should go, even though \\nthat ultimate right should be there for \\nemployers. \\n\\nMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Sen-\\nator yield for a question? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. I yield, of course, to my \\ncolleague from Illinois. \\n\\nMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not a \\nfact that the parties are refusing to ne-\\ngotiate or even discuss the contractual \\nissues at this time? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. That is correct. \\nMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also \\n\\na fact that this sense-of-the-Senate res-\\nolution, which is not now legislation, \\nsimply calls on the company to discuss \\nthe issues with its workers? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. And to negotiate, that is \\ncorrect. \\n\\nMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also \\na fact that the American company with \\nwhich this company is the competition \\nhas already reached closure on the \\nissues that are currently at issue here? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. That is correct. \\nMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also \\n\\na fact that you have taken this oppor-\\ntunity on this bill—and I understand \\nthe Senator from Kansas is concerned \\nabout this coming in the middle of the \\nCongressional Accountability Act, and \\nI think we are all concerned about that \\nand would like to see this legislation \\nresolved. But at the same time, given \\nthe enormity of the concern of the \\ncompany and the workers, is it not a \\nfact that time is of the essence and this \\nwas an opportunity to move on this \\nissue in order to facilitate—or at least \\nencourage—that such discussions take \\nplace over the weekend? \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Absolutely. In terms of \\ncluttering up this bill, as the Senator \\n\\nfrom Kansas indicated, if she will indi-\\ncate to me that she will be happy to \\nsupport this legislation if we introduce \\nit independently and not on this bill, I \\nwill be happy to withdraw it, and we \\nwill bring it up independently. \\n\\nMrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if \\nI may respond. I must say that I am \\nvery sensitive to the concerns the Sen-\\nator has with an industry that is facing \\nsome real turmoil in his State and \\nother States. I realize it is a sense-of- \\nthe-Senate resolution, and it applies \\nspecifically to one private company. \\nWhen you mention the railroad strikes, \\njust to draw a distinction, that was a \\nstrike that affected the whole country \\nand was of national concern. Even then \\nwe were sensitive to intrusion by Con-\\ngress. \\n\\nThe reason I went over the striker re-\\nplacement issue is because you address \\nit in the sense-of-the-Senate resolu-\\ntion. In many ways I would say I am \\nsympathetic. But I do not think that \\nwe should address it here in the United \\nStates Congress. It opens every other \\nprivate labor-management dispute to \\nour wanting to try to address it from \\nWashington and intruding on what is a \\nprivate bargaining position. That is my \\nconcern. I thank the Senator from Illi-\\nnois, even though I recognize Senator \\nSIMON’s and Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN’s \\ninterest in the issue. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am a \\ngreat believer in sitting down and \\nworking things out. Any time anybody \\nin this body wants to put up a resolu-\\ntion for any corporation where there is \\na strike resolution, encouraging both \\nsides to sit down, I am willing to sup-\\nport it. I think that is a sensible posi-\\ntion for the U.S. Senate to take. \\n\\nLet me add that I am willing to vote \\nsoon. I understand Senator HARKIN is \\non his way over here to speak. I hope \\nwe can just give him another minute or \\ntwo to get over here. I am sure he will \\nspeak briefly, because I know some \\npeople are anxious to get out of here. I \\ndo not want to hold anyone up. If no \\none else seeks the floor, I will suggest \\nthe absence of a quorum for about 3 \\nminutes. If Senator HARKIN is not here, \\nwe will move ahead. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The \\nclerk will call the roll. \\n\\nThe bill clerk proceeded to call the \\nroll. \\n\\nMr. SIMON.

I move to lay that mo-\\ntion on the table. \\n\\nThe motion to lay on the table was \\nagreed to. \\n\\nMr. HARKIN addressed the Chair. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\n\\nator from Iowa. \\nMr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was \\n\\nunable to be on the floor prior to the \\nvote to join my colleague from Illinois \\non this debate on this resolution. But I \\ndid want to take a couple minutes now \\nto add my voice in support of the reso-\\nlution that Senator SIMON offered. I \\nwas pleased to be a cosponsor of it. \\n\\nAs Senator SIMON said before the \\nvote, what Bridgestone Corp., a Japa-\\nnese-owned corporation, is doing with \\nour workers at the Firestone plant in \\nmy State of Iowa would be illegal for \\nthem to do in their own country. What \\nthey want to do with our workers \\nwould be illegal in their own country. \\n\\nMr. President, I am very close to the \\nFirestone plant in Des Moines, IA. \\nMany of my cousins work there. In the \\nsmall town of 150 that I come from, al-\\nmost half the town had worked at Fire-\\nstone at one time or another. Many of \\nmy cousins work there. In fact, I spoke \\nto one just yesterday. He has worked \\nthere almost 20 years, has a couple of \\nkids in college, and has given the best \\n\\nyears of his life to Firestone. Now they \\nare told that they can just go take a \\nwalk, that they do not have a contract \\nto operate under, and that they have to \\naccede to what I consider to be uncon-\\nscionable terms that Bridgestone has \\nput up. \\n\\nI might also point out, Mr. President, \\nand for the benefit of my colleagues \\nhere, that the Bridgestone Corp. in \\nJapan also has union employees—Japa-\\nnese union employees in Japan—and \\nthey make tires, just as they do in \\nAmerica. The average annual wage of a \\nJapanese union employee in Japan \\nworking for Bridgestone is $52,500 a \\nyear. In the United States, their aver-\\nage wage is $37,045 a year. \\n\\nYet, Bridgestone is telling our people \\nin this country, our workers, that they \\nhave to take less money. Is that based \\non productivity? Hardly. In March of \\n1994, the workers at the Firestone \\nplant in America reached a new high of \\n80.5 pounds of rubber tire per man hour \\nand set an all-time record, and they did \\nit with 600 fewer workers. So it is not \\nbased on productivity. Bridgestone \\nsimply wants to ratchet down the \\nwages of our American workers, even \\nmuch lower than what they pay their \\nown in Japan. \\n\\nBut most unconscionable, I think, is \\nthe kind of work schedule they want to \\nput them on. Understand this: The \\nBridgestone company has said to the \\nFirestone workers: ‘‘We want you to \\nwork a 12-hour shift.’’ There would be \\ntwo 12-hour shifts a day at their plants. \\nBut then they would work 3 days on a \\n12-hour shift, and they would have 2 \\ndays off. Then they would work 2 days \\non a 12-hour shift and have 3 days off. \\nThen they would work 2 days on a 12- \\nhour shift and have 2 days off. Then \\nthey would come back around and \\nwork 2 days on, 3 days off. You have to \\nhave a calculator to calculate when \\nyour days off will be. \\n\\nYou might be off one Saturday and \\nnot off on another Saturday for 3 \\nweeks. Most of these people have \\nspouses who work and kids in school; \\nthey could never plan to be home with \\ntheir families. And yet the Bridgestone \\nemployees in Japan do not work those \\n12-hour days. They work 8-hour shifts; \\nthree 8-hour shifts a day. They know \\nexactly what days they are going to \\nhave off. \\n\\nBut Bridgestone is telling our work-\\ners: ‘‘Forget it; you can’t plan any \\ntime with your families. You are on \\nthis rotating shift of 12 hours a day.’’ \\nAnd they are going to pay them less \\nmoney. \\n\\nSo I just want to make these points, \\nMr. President, because I think we \\nought to send a signal to Bridgestone \\nCorp. that we just cannot allow our \\nworkers in this country to be treated \\nin that manner. We have had a long \\ntradition of collective bargaining in \\nthis country. With what is happening \\nnow with the replacement of these \\nworkers, the right of collective bar-\\ngaining is a hollow right. The right of \\ncollective bargaining takes with it the \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S561 January 6, 1995 \\nright to be able to bargain with what-\\never power and resources you have. The \\nonly power and resource that a worker \\nhas in this country is to withhold his \\nor her labor. They have no other bar-\\ngaining power. \\n\\nAnd so if that power then becomes a \\nhollow power; if, in fact, I do exercise \\nmy legal right to go on strike and the \\ncompany says, ‘‘Fine, you can do that; \\nthen, bang, I will replace you,’’ then, \\nA, there is no real right to strike, and \\nbecause there is no real right to strike \\nand withhold your labor then, B, there \\nis no real right to collective bargaining \\nany longer in this country. \\n\\nI said to the replacement workers \\nthat were being hired in Des Moines: \\n‘‘You may think you have a good job, \\nbut without a contract, you may not \\nhave a job next year or next week or \\neven tomorrow.’’ In fact, I have already \\nbeen contacted by one of those replace-\\nment workers who was just fired for \\nthe most scant reasons. He said: ‘‘I \\ncame, I thought I had a good job, and \\nthey told me I was fired.’’ \\n\\nSo what is happening to our workers \\nin this country and what Bridgestone \\nis doing to our workers, as Senator \\nSIMON pointed out, is illegal in Japan. \\n\\nI say to Bridgestone/Firestone that \\nthis issue is far from over. The Japa-\\nnese Prime Minister is coming to this \\ncountry next week to meet with our \\nPresident. I intend to take the oppor-\\ntunity, when he is here, to take this \\nfloor to speak about this injustice by a \\nJapanese corporation. \\n\\nNow, I am not blaming the Japanese \\nPrime Minister for this. He may not \\neven know about it. But I want him to \\nknow about it. I want him to know \\nwhat that corporation is doing in this \\ncountry. \\n\\nI know the Japanese Prime Minister \\nis interested in good relations between \\nJapan and America. I am, too. I do not \\nwant to join those who are bashing \\nJapan. They are a good, strong ally and \\na good friend of ours. I respect them \\nhighly, and I like them. I spent a year \\nand a half of my life living in Japan. \\nBut this kind of action by this corpora-\\ntion is unconscionable. I believe that \\nthe Government of Japan ought to be \\nlooking into what this company is \\ndoing with their workers in this coun-\\ntry. \\n\\nSo I intend, as I said, Mr. President \\nto take this floor next week when the \\nPrime Minister of Japan is here to once \\nagain talk about this company and \\nwhat it is doing so that he is not mis-\\ntaken in any way, so that he takes \\nback with him the strong feelings that \\nthis Senator and I believe the people I \\nrepresent have about the gross injus-\\ntice being perpetrated on the Firestone \\nworkers in this country. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield? \\nMr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield. \\nMr. SIMON. I wish to commend him \\n\\nfor his statement, and I simply want \\nthe officers of that corporation to \\nknow this vote today was just the first \\nsalvo. This is not the end of the road. \\nThe Senator is talking about when the \\n\\nJapanese Prime Minister is here. I do \\nnot know what other opportunities we \\nare going to have. All I know is what \\nhas happened is wrong, wrong, wrong. \\nWe have to turn it around in some way. \\n\\nI do not know whether the rubber \\nworkers are right in all their requests. \\nI do not know all the things that man-\\nagement has requested. All I know is \\nthat the right way to settle this dis-\\npute is to sit down and work it out be-\\ntween labor and management, not to \\nhire workers permanently to replace \\nworkers of those families the Senator \\nis talking about. \\n\\nSo I commend my colleague, and I \\nlook forward to working with him. \\n\\nMr. HARKIN. My colleague is abso-\\nlutely right. In fact, the Department of \\nLabor has had the Federal Mediation \\nService working on this case for quite \\nsome months. They have been working \\nin good faith to try to resolve these dif-\\nferences. They have been very close. \\nThere is not that much separating the \\ntwo parties. I think if Bridgestone/ \\nFirestone would in good faith sit down \\nand negotiate, they could reach an am-\\nicable settlement of the strike. \\n\\nMr. SIMON. The Senator from Iowa \\nis absolutely correct. It is interesting \\nthat the former chief executive of the \\nAmerican operation received awards \\nfor his labor-management relations and \\nthe improvement of productivity that \\ntook place. Now, all of a sudden, with \\nthe change in executives, things went \\ndownhill fast. We have to do what we \\ncan to encourage the two sides to get \\ntogether. \\n\\nMr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague. I \\nhave a letter to the editor of the Des \\nMoines Register written by a farmer \\nwho was commenting on this strike, \\nwhat Bridgestone was doing. \\n\\nHe said I went out and counted and \\nthat he counted his tractors, trucks, \\nwagons, combine, there were over 140 \\ntires. He said that should Bridgestone \\ncontinue to refuse to negotiate, he \\nwould never buy a tire made by them. \\nI would like to ask unanimous consent \\nthat a copy of this letter to the editor \\nand several others be included in the \\nrecord at the conclusion of my state-\\nment. \\n\\nI think that ought to be a signal to \\nBridgestone/Firestone. There are other \\ntires out there, and I know this Sen-\\nator and probably a lot of the workers \\nin this country who drive automobiles \\nare going to look askance at \\nBridgestone/Firestone if they will not \\nsit down and work this thing out and \\nwill feel that maybe there are other \\ntires they can buy and maybe there \\nought to be a boycott against buying \\ntires from Bridgestone/Firestone if \\nthey are going to treat our people in \\nthis manner. \\n\\nThere being no objection, the letters \\nto the editor were ordered to be printed \\nin the RECORD, as follows: \\n\\nTHE REGISTER’S READERS SAY—A TIRE \\nCOMPANY’S ‘‘ASSAULT’’ ON UNION \\n\\nThe situation at Bridgestone/Firestone has \\nbeen of great concern to me since the strike \\nbegan. \\n\\nIt is a continuation of the story family \\nfarmers and our laboring friends have experi-\\nenced since 1980 from those who want cheap \\nraw materials and labor to maximize their \\nprofits. \\n\\nA quick inventory tells me that my trac-\\ntor, trucks, wagons, combine and cars roll on \\nmore than 140 tires. My vow to Bridgestone/ \\nFirestone is that if this strike is not settled \\nwithin 30 days, I will never buy another tire \\nmade by them—Joe Weisshaar, chairman, \\nIowa Farm Unity Coalition. \\n\\nThere are many ways to do violence. \\nTwelve workers at Bridgestone/Firestone \\nwere fired by the company three days before \\nChristmas as a response to what the com-\\npany referred to as ‘‘acts of violence, threats \\nand aggressive behavior.’’ \\n\\nI do not condone physical violence and \\nphysical threats. Most of us abhor such \\nthings as they occur in labor confrontations. \\nHowever, that is what company officials are \\ncounting on in this situation as they commit \\ntheir own brand of violence by refusing to \\nbargain in good faith for an end to the \\nstrike. The company is using its financial \\nmight as a club over the workers. \\n\\nThe management of Bridgestone/Firestone \\nwants nothing less than complete capitula-\\ntion by the members of the United Rubber \\nWorkers union. The union is trying to hang \\non to benefits gained over the years in legiti-\\nmate negotiating processes. \\n\\nIt behooves the rest of us in the commu-\\nnity to understand that what is happening \\nout on Second Avenue in Des Moines and at \\nthe other Bridgestone/Firestone locations \\naround the country is an attempt to further \\nerode the rights of workers to maintain some \\ncontrol over their own lives, minds and bod-\\nies rather than become the de facto property \\nof the company. \\n\\nDo not be fooled by the actions of the man-\\nagement of Bridgestone/Firestone. It is every \\nbit as violent (and more so) as any act of \\nphysical violence on the picket line in its de-\\nstructive effects on human life.—The Rev. \\nCarlos C. Jayne, Des Moines Area Urban Mis-\\nsion Council, The United Methodist Church. \\n\\nBridgestone/Firestone’s strategy to wear \\ndown the striking tire workers is becoming \\nmore self-evident: undercut public support \\nby repeatedly making strikers look like the \\nbad guys. Three recent examples are instruc-\\ntive: \\n\\n(1) In firing 12 union members, a company \\nspokesman cited ‘‘violence, threats, and ag-\\ngressive behavior’’ as the reason for dis-\\nmissal. \\n\\n(2) Firestone’s request for an injunction \\nlimiting the number of picketers implied \\nthat strikers in groups larger than two pre-\\nsented a danger to company employees. \\n\\n(3) During a peaceful march, when a hand-\\nful of strike supporters (many from out of \\nstate) threw snowballs toward the plant, the \\ncompany and TV stations described the \\nevent as a ‘‘riot.’’ This amounted to an ab-\\nsurd exaggeration. But the message to view-\\ners was ‘‘These guys are dangerous.’’ \\n\\nSince the strike began, I have visited the \\npicket line 20 or 30 times and have spoken \\nwith maybe 100 striking tire workers. I have \\nyet to meet a single one who condones the \\nisolated acts of violence that have occurred \\non both sides of the conflict. \\n\\nIn fact, given the financial and emotional \\nhardships they have suffered, the strikers de-\\nserve praise for the extent to which they \\nhave remained peaceful and nonviolent. \\n\\nFirestone’s focus on violence may sell to \\nthe media, but it distracts public attention \\nfrom the real issue: Management wants more \\nconcessions, while the union feels it’s al-\\nready given up enough. Given the workers’ \\nsolidarity and the fairness of their position, \\nI am convinced this strike will end only \\nwhen the company agrees to come to the \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES562 January 6, 1995 \\ntable and talk.—Ed Fallon, State representa-\\ntive. \\n\\nMr. HARKIN.

Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\n\\nf \\n\\nA SIGNIFICANT COMMITTEE \\nASSIGNMENT \\n\\nMr. GORTON. Mr. President, as a re-\\nsult of committee assignments an-\\nnounced yesterday, I have the privilege \\nand delight to be a member, for the \\nnext 2 years, of the Committee on \\nLabor and Human Resources. I want to \\ntake this opportunity to discuss, in \\ngeneral, why I feel that assignment to \\nbe so significant and why I feel so priv-\\nileged to be a member of a committee \\nwith the jurisdiction that it possesses. \\nI also want to discuss one specific issue \\nwhich has been discussed in that com-\\nmittee in the past, which I regard as \\nbeing of peculiar and special impor-\\ntance. \\n\\nFirst, however, I express my delight \\nin being a member of the committee \\nchaired by the distinguished junior \\nSenator from Kansas [Mrs. KASSEBAUM] \\nwho has been, during the course of the \\nlast Congress, my seat mate in this \\npart of the body and will continue to be \\nso. I look forward to her leadership and \\nto her wise advice and counsel. Issues \\nwhich will come before the Labor Com-\\nmittee include many that are of vital \\nconcern to all Americans in today’s \\nworld. These issues include those relat-\\ning to aging, to disability policies, \\noverwhelmingly to education, to fami-\\nlies and children, to employment, and \\nto productivity. \\n\\nI see two profound tidal changes in \\nAmerican society today that are driv-\\ning the concerns of millions upon mil-\\nlions of our people. As the United \\nStates is in the midst of an inevitable \\nshift of its economic base from an in-\\ndustrial/manufacturing system to an \\ninformation-based economy, millions \\nof families find their justified expecta-\\ntions shattered and find themselves in \\na new and very difficult world. This \\nshift gives every promise of being as \\ncataclysmic as the shift from an agrar-\\nian-based economy to an industrial- \\nbased economy in the latter part of the \\nlast century and the beginning of this \\ncentury. \\n\\nUnderstandably, many people are \\ndeeply concerned and apprehensive \\nabout this change, about the direction \\nin which our country is heading, and \\n\\nwish that it were not so. It is so, how-\\never, and we need to meet that chal-\\nlenge. \\n\\nThe American people understand \\nthat the societal contract is changing \\nand that we must change with it. \\nToday, the receipt of a high school di-\\nploma, or for that matter a college di-\\nploma, lacks the meaning it once had. \\nSome families, some people are stuck \\non welfare and have few, if any, alter-\\nnatives which they see as being viable. \\nToday, there is no such thing as guar-\\nanteed lifetime employment. Working \\nfamilies find it more and more difficult \\nto get ahead. Sending both parents into \\nthe workplace used to be a matter of \\nchoice, sometimes as a fulfillment for \\nthe second spouse to be employed, \\nsometimes as an option to help a fam-\\nily buy a new home or to take a special \\ntrip. Today, for far too many, it is not \\na choice but a necessity. It makes or \\nbreaks a family’s budget. And without \\ntwo paychecks, bills would not be paid \\nand the children might not be fed. \\nWomen in the workplace still find \\nthemselves stuck in either clerical or \\nmiddle management positions and \\ntheir growth stopped dead short by a \\nglass ceiling that has not yet dis-\\nappeared. Families are still deeply con-\\ncerned about health care; some cannot \\nchange jobs for fear of losing their in-\\nsurance; others let illness drag on be-\\ncause there is no money to pay in an \\nuninsured situation; and many worry \\nabout retirement security. No indi-\\nvidual wants to spend his or her golden \\nyears being taken care of, being de-\\npendent upon their children. But it \\nseems increasingly difficult to save \\nmoney for retirement. \\n\\nAll of this I believe to be the most \\nsignificant cause of the consistently \\nfound proposition that the majority of \\nthe American people feel that the \\ncountry is moving in the wrong direc-\\ntion, that the programs of this Govern-\\nment do not help, but actually hinder, \\nthe ability of our citizens efficiently to \\nmanage their lives in a changing econ-\\nomy. \\n\\nAs a result, I am excited and de-\\nlighted about the challenges and about \\nthe prospects of being on a committee \\nthat is designed to address precisely \\nthese challenges. I believe we need to \\nreorient the programs of the Federal \\nGovernment to deal with this new re-\\nality. Only when this Government un-\\nderstands this changing reality will \\nAmericans believe that their Govern-\\nment is once again on the right track. \\nI think the committee and its Members \\ncan make a difference. \\n\\nBeyond my desire to work with my \\ndistinguished colleague from Kansas \\nand others on these paramount issues, \\nI am convinced that one of the most \\nimportant issues facing this country \\ntoday is the need to educate our chil-\\ndren in an environment conducive to \\nlearning. In the age of information, \\nnothing—nothing at all—is more im-\\nportant to America’s success than a \\nwell-educated citizenry. \\n\\nIn that connection, I believe the larg-\\nest single threat to successful edu-\\n\\ncation today is the growing spate of vi-\\nolence in our schools. \\n\\nA year ago this month, I held an edu-\\ncation conference in Fife, WA, at which \\neducators and parents from across \\nWashington State spent an entire day \\ndiscussing what the Federal Govern-\\nment could do to improve our system \\nof education. For the first time in a \\nlong career, the No. 1 priority was not \\nmore money, it was not more teachers \\nin specific areas, it was not longer \\nschool days. The men and women and \\nkids at this conference talked about \\nschool violence. \\n\\nIn Washington State, violent crimes \\nby young people have doubled in the \\npast decade in spite of a 3-percent drop \\nin the number of students. Recently, \\nour superintendent of public instruc-\\ntion released a report that calculated a \\ntotal of 2,237 incidents of firearms or \\ndangerous weapons violations reported \\nby school districts and by private \\nschools. And just today, of course, in \\nthe Washington Post, we see of a gun- \\ninduced killing at the very door of one \\nof the high schools in the District of \\nColumbia. \\n\\nTeachers and parents from all around \\nWashington State have shared with me \\nhorror stories of violence in their chil-\\ndrens’ schools: First graders threat-\\nening their peers with screwdrivers; a \\nfourth grader extorting lunch money at \\nknife point; a sixth grader who brought \\na fake but real-looking gun to school \\nand threatened fellow students’ lives \\nwith it. \\n\\nHow can we expect our children to \\nlearn calculus and Tolstoy when they \\nare afraid of walking the halls between \\nclasses? \\n\\nOn the issue of school violence, the \\nrole of the Federal Government has not \\nbeen a positive one. This Government \\nhas not concerned itself sufficiently \\nwith the safety of children threatened \\nby these violent students. The Federal \\nGovernment does not concern them-\\nselves with the safety of the faculty \\nand administrators in these schools. It \\ndoes not seem sufficiently concerned \\nwith the disruptive impact of violence \\nin the learning process. In fact, the \\nrules and regulations pursuant to stat-\\nutes passed by this Congress on the \\npart of the Federal Government has se-\\nverely limited the ability of local \\nschool officials and teachers to deal ef-\\nfectively with violence in our schools. \\nIt has, in many respects, tied their \\nhands. It has set up a double standard, \\ndepending upon the classification of \\nstudents in our schools, with respect to \\nthe discipline of violent students who \\nbring guns into the schools. \\n\\nMr. President, this is profoundly the \\nwrong direction in which to go. I am \\nfrustrated because the Federal Govern-\\nment, in fact, is making it far more dif-\\nficult for communities to create an en-\\nvironment in our schools conducive to \\nlearning.

Although \\non both occasions our amendment was \\naccepted first by a voice vote and sec-\\nondly by an overwhelming majority, in \\neach occasion it was dropped in con-\\nference. I felt so strongly about this \\nprovision that I voted against the final \\npassage of the Elementary and Sec-\\nondary Education Act late last fall. \\n\\nThere are, of course, some who will \\ncontinue to disagree with this goal, \\nwho will continue to find that only the \\nFederal Government is capable of mak-\\ning value judgments among students \\nwhen violence is at issue. I am cer-\\ntainly going to be willing to work with \\nthose who disagree and to craft a pol-\\nicy that will attempt to deal with their \\nconcerns. But our primary goal, one \\nwhich cannot be compromised, must be \\nto restore local control to the edu-\\ncators—who are on the firing line, who \\nare in the classroom—the right, the \\nprivilege, and the duty to deal with \\nschool violence. \\n\\nI intend to work, as a member of the \\nLabor Committee, to ensure that the \\nFederal Government does not stand in \\nthe way of educating our children in a \\nsafe and positive environment. \\n\\nI invite all of the school teachers and \\nprincipals and their organizations \\naround the country who have stories to \\ntell about how Federal rules and regu-\\nlations have tied their hands when it \\ncomes to dealing with violent students \\nto contact me, to contact my staff, to \\ncontact the committee. I want to know \\nhow I can make certain that the Fed-\\neral Government does not make this \\nproblem worse. \\n\\nI want you to know that this Senator \\ntrusts the teachers and administrators \\nof the schools of this country and \\nwants to give to them the flexibility to \\ndeal with these challenges. We must do \\neverything we can to ensure that our \\nchildren go to school in an environ-\\nment conducive to learning, and that \\nmeans an environment safe for them \\nand for their teachers. \\n\\nMr. President, I suggest the absence \\nof a quorum. \\n\\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide for restitu-\\ntion of victims of crimes, and for other \\npurposes; to the Committee on the Ju-\\ndiciary. \\n\\nCRIME VICTIMS RESTITUTION ACT \\n\\nMr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have \\ncome to the floor today to reintroduce \\nthe Crime Victims Restitution Act. \\nLast fall when the Senate passed it’s \\nversion of the crime bill, I lauded the \\ninclusion of my victim’s rights and \\nmandatory restitution provisions in \\nthe legislation. Three years ago, I in-\\ntroduced the Victim’s Rights and Res-\\ntitution Act, and many of those vic-\\ntim’s rights provisions passed as part \\nof the 1990 crime bill. However, each \\ntime this restitution provision has \\npassed the Senate it has subsequently \\nbeen dropped in conference. \\n\\nPasage of this legislation would sig-\\nnal a great victory for all victims of \\ncrime. If these provisions become law, \\ncrime victims will enjoy rights at the \\nFederal level that many States already \\nguarantee. Most important are the \\nact’s restitution provisions, making \\ncriminals pay for their crimes. Under \\nthe legislation, crime victims will be \\nentitled to receive full financial com-\\npensation directly from the criminal in \\nthe form of mandatory restitution. \\n\\nOver the last several years, it seems \\nwe have continuously debated what \\nshould be done to improve our Nation’s \\njudicial system. Now is the time to do \\nsomething about it. I strongly believe \\nour judicial system needs fundamental \\nreform to help our police officers and \\ncourts deal with the overwhelming in-\\ncrease in crime. Furthermore, it is cru-\\ncial that while trying to facilitate \\nmore effective and efficient methods of \\ndealing with criminals, we must not \\nforget about the most important part \\nof the crime-fighting equation: The \\nvictims. \\n\\nIn 1990, I authored the crime victim’s \\nbill of rights which passed as part of \\nthe 1990 crime bill. For crimes tried in \\nFederal court, victims now have the \\nright to be notified of and involved in \\ncourt proceedings, the right to be pro-\\ntected from the accused, the right to be \\ntreated fairly and with respect, and the \\nright to be informed of the detention \\nstatus of the convicted criminal. \\n\\nHowever, passage of just the victims \\nrights portion of my proposal left some \\nunfinished business. Crime victims \\nshould be entitled to compensation for \\nlosses sustained from their victimiza-\\ntion. This glaring inequity was rem-\\nedied in the crime bill when it passed \\nthe Senate last year. It contained man-\\ndates that courts order restitution in \\nall Federal criminal cases. Victims \\nwould be able to recover financial \\nlosses resulting from the criminal act. \\nThis restitution order would be a con-\\ndition of any form of release for the of-\\nfender. The legislation would ensure \\n\\nthat the criminal not only pays his \\ndebt to society, but he also pays his \\ndebt to his victim. However, the Demo-\\ncrats in the House voted to delete these \\nprovisions from the final crime bill. \\n\\nThe provisions of this legislation also \\noverturn the Supreme Court’s ruling in \\nthe Hughey case which stated restitu-\\ntion could not be ordered for crimes be-\\nyond the scope of the offense of convic-\\ntion. So, if a criminal is convicted of a \\ncriminal offense, but plea bargains his \\nway out of a conviction on a second of-\\nfense, he cannot be held responsible to \\nrepay the victim of the second offense. \\nThis obvious shortcoming would be \\ncorrected by allowing the court to con-\\nsider the course of criminal conduct \\nand order restitution for crimes other \\nthan the offense of conviction. Plea \\nbargains should not result in victims \\nbeing denied the justice they deserve \\nwhich certainly includes full restitu-\\ntion from the offender. \\n\\nOver the years mandatory restitution \\nhas received the written endorsements \\nof victim rights experts across the Na-\\ntion including the National Organiza-\\ntion for Victim Assistance, the Na-\\ntional Victim Center, Mothers Against \\nDrunk Driving, and the National Coali-\\ntion Against Sexual Assault. \\n\\nThis landmark victim’s legislation \\nneeds to be enacted into law. Manda-\\ntory restitution, while not healing all \\nthe wounds associated with a crime, \\nwill provide some compensation to help \\npeople who have been victimized and \\nallow them to get their lives back in \\norder. If Congress reconsiders crime \\nlegislation this year, these provisions \\ncertainly need to be a part of the final \\nbill. \\n\\nf \\n\\nADDITIONAL COSPONSORS \\n\\nS. 3 \\n\\nAt the request of Mr. DOLE, the name \\nof the Senator from New Hampshire \\n[Mr. SMITH] was added as a cosponsor \\nof S. 3, a bill to control crime, and for \\nother purposes. \\n\\nS. 145 \\n\\nAt the request of Mr. GRAMM, the \\nname of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \\nGRASSLEY] was added as a cosponsor of \\nS. 145, a bill to provide appropriate pro-\\ntection for the constitutional guar-\\nantee of private property rights, and \\nfor other purposes. \\n\\nSENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 6 \\n\\nAt the request of Mr. THURMOND, the \\nname of the Senator from Alabama \\n[Mr. HEFLIN] was added as a cosponsor \\nof Senate Joint Resolution 6, a joint \\nresolution proposing an amendment to \\nthe Constitution of the United States \\nrelating to voluntary school prayer. \\n\\nAMENDMENT NO. 4 \\n\\nAt the request of Mr. BRADLEY, his \\nname was added as a cosponsor of \\namendment No. 4 proposed to S. 2, a \\nbill to make certain laws applicable to \\nthe legislative branch of the Federal \\nGovernment. \\n\\nSENATE RESOLUTION 31—REL-\\nATIVE TO THE ATTORNEY GEN-\\nERAL \\n\\nMrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. MUR-\\nRAY, Mr. FEINGOLD, Mr. KERRY, Mr. \\nKENNEDY, Mr. CAMPBELL, Mr. SIMON, \\nMr. LAUTENBERG, Mr. DODD, Mr. BAU-\\nCUS, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. LIEBERMAN, Ms. \\nMOSELEY-BRAUN, Mr. HARKIN, Mr. JEF-\\nFORDS, Mr. PELL, Mr. CHAFEE, Ms. \\nSNOWE, Mr. INOUYE, and Mr. BRADLEY) \\nsubmitted the following resolution; \\nwhich was referred to the Committee \\non the Judiciary: \\n\\nS.

That \\nis why I am pleased that my legislation \\nhas bipartisan support. \\n\\nIn 1994 there were over 130 incidents \\nnationwide of violence or harassment \\ndirected at clinics and the people who \\nwork there. They include 50 reports of \\ndeath threats to doctors and other clin-\\nic workers, 40 incidents of vandalism, \\n16 incidents of stalking, 4 acts of arson \\nand 3 attempted bombings. \\n\\nTragically, since the murder of Dr. \\nDavid Gunn in March, 1993 outside of \\nthe Pensacola Women’s Health Clinic \\nthere have been four additional \\nslayings at clinics. \\n\\nIn July, 1994 Dr. John Britton and his \\nescort Jim Barret were shot to death \\nat The Ladies’ Center in Pensacola, \\nFL. Mr. Barret’s wife was injured. \\n\\nOn December 30, Shannon Lowney \\nand Leanne Nichols were shot and \\nkilled while working at reproductive \\nhealth care clincs in Massachusetts. \\nFive others were wounded. A day later \\nthe gunman fired shots at another clin-\\nic in Virginia. \\n\\nThe resolution I am submitting \\ntoday urges the Attorney General to \\nuse all of the tools at her disposal to \\nstop this escalating violence, including \\nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic En-\\ntrances Act which we passed last year, \\nthe FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service. \\n\\nI urge my colleagues to join me in \\nworking to protect our Nation’s repro-\\nductive health care clinics from violent \\nattack. \\n\\nMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the \\nmurderous assaults at two clinics in \\nBrookline, Massachusetts last week \\nwere despicable acts of terrorism. This \\nkind of vicious, hateful assault against \\nwomen and health care providers can-\\nnot be tolerated in any community in \\nAmerica. \\n\\nTwo women who worked at the \\nBrookline clinics, Shannon Lowney \\nand Lee Ann Nichols, had their lives \\nbrutally cut short. Five other people \\nwere seriously wounded, and four of \\nthem are still hospitalized. My heart \\ngoes out to these victims and their \\nfamilies. \\n\\nNo effort can be spared to make sure \\nthat these crimes are not repeated any-\\nwhere else. Women must be able to \\nseek reproductive health care without \\nfear of violent assault. Doctors should \\nbe able to practice their profession \\nwithout wearing bullet-proof vests. \\nClinic staff should be able to go to \\nwork each day in safety. \\n\\nAbortion is a constitutionally pro-\\ntected right, and it must be safe and \\naccessible. Many of the clinics targeted \\nby violence and obstruction provide a \\n\\nwide range of health care services for \\nwomen, including family planning and \\nprenatal care. We cannot allow access \\nto these important services to be re-\\nduced or blocked. \\n\\nLast year, we passed and President \\nClinton signed the Freedom of Access \\nto Clinic Entrances Act. That law gives \\nthe Attorney General the tools she \\nneeds to prevent violence and obstruc-\\ntion and to punish such acts whenever \\nand wherever they occur with the full \\nforce of Federal law. The Justice De-\\npartment has already brought several \\nenforcement actions under this law, \\nand it is actively investigating other \\npossible violations. In addition, the At-\\ntorney General has made U.S. Marshals \\navailable to protect clinics. \\n\\nSome have suggested that the new \\nFederal law is somehow responsible for \\nfomenting violence at abortion clinics, \\nbecause it allegedly closes off peaceful \\npicketing as an outlet for those with \\nstrongly held views against abortion. \\nAny such suggestion is nonsense. \\n\\nThe clinic access law does not pro-\\nhibit or punish peaceful picketing or \\nany other expression protected by the \\nfirst amendment. On the contrary, it \\nexpressly allows it. What the act pro-\\nhibits is violent, threatening, obstruc-\\ntive, or destructive conduct—none of \\nwhich has ever been protected by the \\nConstitution. For that reason, every \\none of the Federal courts that have \\nbeen asked to review the law since \\nPresident Clinton signed it last year \\nhas upheld it. \\n\\nTough laws against clinic blockades \\nand clinic violence are not the prob-\\nlem. They are the solution. \\n\\nI commend President Clinton and At-\\ntorney General Reno for their vigorous \\nenforcement of the new Federal law, \\nand for their commitment to work \\nwith local law enforcement authorities \\nto protect the clinics throughout the \\ncountry. They are doing everything in \\ntheir power to guarantee public safety \\nand deter the use of violent tactics \\naimed at patients and providers. \\n\\nI am proud to join in sponsoring this \\nlegislation. The Senate must go on \\nrecord unequivocally to denounce the \\nviolence, and to express our solid sup-\\nport for vigorous enforcement and im-\\nplementation of the Federal clinic pro-\\ntection law. I hope that every Member \\nof the Senate will join in supporting \\nthis important measure. \\n\\nf \\n\\nSENATE RESOLUTION 32—MAKING \\nMINORITY PARTY APPOINT-\\nMENTS TO SENATE COMMITTEES \\n\\nMr. DASCHLE submitted the fol-\\nlowing resolution; which was consid-\\nered and agreed to: \\n\\nS.

Mr. President, on Janu-\\nary 4, 1995, I introduced S. 135, the \\nProperty Rights Litigation Relief Act \\nof 1995. Because of the great interest \\nshown in the bill, I ask that it be print-\\ned in the RECORD at this point. \\n\\nThe bill follows: \\nS. 135 \\n\\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-\\nresentatives of the United States of America in \\nCongress assembled, \\nSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. \\n\\nThis Act may be cited as the ‘‘Property \\nRights Litigation Relief Act of 1995’’. \\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS. \\n\\nThe Congress finds that— \\n(1) the private ownership of property is es-\\n\\nsential to a free society and is an integral \\npart of the American tradition of liberty and \\nlimited government; \\n\\n(2) the framers of the United States Con-\\nstitution, in order to protect private prop-\\nerty and liberty, devised a framework of \\nGovernment designed to diffuse power and \\nlimit Government; \\n\\n(3) to further ensure the protection of pri-\\nvate property, the fifth amendment to the \\nUnited States Constitution was ratified to \\nprevent the taking of private property by the \\nFederal Government, except for public use \\nand with just compensation; \\n\\n(4) the purpose of the takings clause of the \\nfifth amendment of the United States Con-\\nstitution, as the Supreme Court stated in \\nArmstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 \\n(1960), is ‘‘to bar Government from forcing \\nsome people alone to bear public burdens, \\nwhich in all fairness and justice, should be \\nborne by the public as a whole’’; \\n\\n(5) the Federal Government, in its haste to \\nameliorate public harms and environmental \\nabuse, has singled out property holders to \\nshoulder the cost that should be borne by the \\npublic, in violation of the just compensation \\nrequirement of the takings clause of the fifth \\namendment of the United States Constitu-\\ntion; \\n\\n(6) there is a need to both restrain the Fed-\\neral Government in its overzealous regula-\\ntion of the private sector and to protect pri-\\nvate property, which is a fundamental right \\nof the American people; \\n\\n(7) the incremental, fact-specific approach \\nthat courts now are required to employ in \\nthe absence of adequate statutory language \\nto vindicate property rights under the fifth \\namendment of the United States Constitu-\\ntion has been ineffective and costly and \\nthere is a need for Congress to clarify the \\nlaw and provide an effective remedy; \\n\\n(8) certain provisions of sections 1346 and \\n1402 and chapter 91 of title 28, United States \\nCode (commonly known as the Tucker Act), \\nthat delineates the jurisdiction of courts \\nhearing property rights claims, complicates \\nthe ability of a property owner to vindicate \\na property owner’s right to just compensa-\\ntion for a governmental action that has \\ncaused a physical or regulatory taking; \\n\\n(9) current law— \\n(A) forces a property owner to elect be-\\n\\ntween equitable relief in the district court \\nand monetary relief (the value of the prop-\\nerty taken) in the United States Court of \\nFederal Claims; \\n\\n(B) is used to urge dismissal in the district \\ncourt on the ground that the plaintiff should \\nseek just compensation in the Court of Fed-\\neral Claims; and \\n\\n(C) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of \\nFederal Claims on the ground that plaintiff \\nshould seek equitable relief in district court; \\n\\n(10) property owners cannot fully vindicate \\nproperty rights in one court; \\n\\n(11) property owners should be able to fully \\nrecover for a taking of their private property \\nin one court; \\n\\n(12) certain provisions of section 1346 and \\n1402 and chapter 91 of title 28, United States \\nCode (commonly known as the Tucker Act) \\nshould be amended, giving both the district \\ncourts of the United States and the Court of \\n\\nFederal Claims jurisdiction to hear all \\nclaims relating to property rights; and \\n\\n(13) section 1500 of title 28, United States \\nCode, which denies the Court of Federal \\nClaims jurisdiction to entertain a suit which \\nis pending in another court and made by the \\nsame plaintiff, should be repealed. \\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE. \\n\\nThe purpose of this Act is to— \\n(1) encourage, support, and promote the \\n\\nprivate ownership of property by ensuring \\nthe constitutional and legal protection of \\nprivate property by the United States Gov-\\nernment; \\n\\n(2) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient \\njudicial process whereby aggrieved property \\nowners can obtain vindication of property \\nrights guaranteed by the fifth amendment to \\nthe United States Constitution and this Act; \\n\\n(3) amend certain provisions of the Tucker \\nAct, including the repeal of section 1500 of \\ntitle 28, United States Code; \\n\\n(4) rectify the constitutional imbalance be-\\ntween the Federal Government and the \\nStates; and \\n\\n(5) require the Federal Government to \\ncompensate property owners for the depriva-\\ntion of property rights that result from \\nState agencies’ enforcement of federally \\nmandated programs. \\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. \\n\\nFor purposes of this Act the term— \\n(1) ‘‘agency’’ means a department, agency, \\n\\nindependent agency, or instrumentality of \\nthe United States, including any military de-\\npartment, Government corporation, Govern-\\nment-controlled corporation, or other estab-\\nlishment in the executive branch of the \\nUnited States Government; \\n\\n(2) ‘‘agency action’’ means any action or \\ndecision taken by an agency that— \\n\\n(A) takes a property right; or \\n(B) unreasonably impedes the use of prop-\\n\\nerty or the exercise of property interests or \\nsignificantly interferes with investment- \\nbacked expectations; \\n\\n(3) ‘‘just compensation’’— \\n(A) means compensation equal to the full \\n\\nextent of a property owner’s loss, including \\nthe fair market value of the private property \\ntaken and business losses arising from a tak-\\ning, whether the taking is by physical occu-\\npation or through regulation, exaction, or \\nother means; and \\n\\n(B) shall include compounded interest cal-\\nculated from the date of the taking until the \\ndate the United States tenders payment; \\n\\n(4) ‘‘owner’’ means the owner or possessor \\nof property or rights in property at the time \\nthe taking occurs, including when— \\n\\n(A) the statute, regulation, rule, order, \\nguideline, policy, or action is passed or pro-\\nmulgated; or \\n\\n(B) the permit, license, authorization, or \\ngovernmental permission is denied or sus-\\npended; \\n\\n(5) ‘‘private property’’ or ‘‘property’’ \\nmeans all property protected under the fifth \\namendment to the Constitution of the \\nUnited States, any applicable Federal or \\nState law, or this Act, and includes— \\n\\n(A) real property, whether vested or \\nunvested, including— \\n\\n(i) estates in fee, life estates, estates for \\nyears, or otherwise; \\n\\n(ii) inchoate interests in real property such \\nas remainders and future interests; \\n\\n(iii) personalty that is affixed to or appur-\\ntenant to real property; \\n\\n(iv) easements; \\n(v) leaseholds; \\n(vi) recorded liens; and \\n(vii) contracts or other security interests \\n\\nin, or related to, real property; \\n(B) the right to use water or the right to \\n\\nreceive water, including any recorded lines \\non such water right; \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES568 January 6, 1995 \\n(C) rents, issues, and profits of land, in-\\n\\ncluding minerals, timber, fodder, crops, oil \\nand gas, coal, or geothermal energy; \\n\\n(D) property rights provided by, or memo-\\nrialized in, a contract, except that such \\nrights shall not be construed under this title \\nto prevent the United States from prohib-\\niting the formation of contracts deemed to \\nharm the public welfare or to prevent the \\nexecution of contracts for— \\n\\n(i) national security reasons; or \\n(ii) exigencies that present immediate or \\n\\nreasonably foreseeable threats or injuries to \\nlife or property; \\n\\n(E) any interest defined as property under \\nState law; or \\n\\n(F) any interest understood to be property \\nbased on custom, usage, common law, or mu-\\ntually reinforcing understandings suffi-\\nciently well-grounded in law to back a claim \\nof interest; \\n\\n(6) ‘‘State agency’’ means any State de-\\npartment, agency, political subdivision, or \\ninstrumentality that— \\n\\n(A) carries out or enforces a regulatory \\nprogram required under Federal law; \\n\\n(B) is delegated administrative or sub-\\nstantive responsibility under a Federal regu-\\nlatory program; or \\n\\n(C) receives Federal funds in connection \\nwith a regulatory program established by a \\nState, \\n\\nif the State enforcement of the regulatory \\nprogram, or the receipt of Federal funds in \\nconnection with a regulatory program estab-\\nlished by a state, is directly related to the \\ntaking of private property seeking to be vin-\\ndicated under this Act; and \\n\\n(7) ‘‘taking of private property’’— \\n(A) means any action whereby private \\n\\nproperty is directly taken as to require com-\\npensation under the fifth amendment to the \\nUnited States Constitution or under this \\nAct, including by physical invasion, regula-\\ntion, exaction, condition, or other means; \\nand \\n\\n(B) shall not include— \\n(i) a condemnation action filed by the \\n\\nUnited States in an applicable court; or \\n(ii) an action filed by the United States re-\\n\\nlating to criminal forfeiture. \\n\\nSEC. 5. COMPENSATION FOR TAKEN PROPERTY. \\n\\n(a) IN GENERAL.—No agency or State agen-\\ncy, shall take private property except for \\npublic purpose and with just compensation \\nto the property owner. A property owner \\nshall receive just compensation if— \\n\\n(1) as a consequence of a decision of any \\nagency, or State agency, private property \\n(whether all or in part) has been physically \\ninvaded or taken for public use without the \\nconsent of the owner; and \\n\\n(2)(A) such action does not substantially \\nadvance the stated governmental interest to \\nbe achieved by the legislation or regulation \\non which the action is based; \\n\\n(B) such action exacts the owner’s con-\\nstitutional or otherwise lawful right to use \\nthe property or a portion of such property as \\na condition for the granting of a permit, li-\\ncense, variance, or any other agency action \\nwithout a rough proportionality between the \\nstated need for the required dedication and \\nthe impact of the proposed use of the prop-\\nerty; \\n\\n(C) such action results in the property \\nowner being deprived, either temporarily or \\npermanently, of all or substantially all eco-\\nnomically beneficial or productive use of the \\nproperty or that part of the property af-\\nfected by the action without a showing that \\nsuch deprivation inheres in the title itself; \\n\\n(D) such action diminishes the fair market \\nvalue of the affected portion of the property \\nwhich is the subject of the action by the less-\\ner of— \\n\\n(i) 20 percent or more with respect to the \\nvalue immediately prior to the govern-\\nmental action; or \\n\\n(ii) $10,000, or more with respect to the \\nvalue immediately prior to the govern-\\nmental action; or \\n\\n(E) under any other circumstance where a \\ntaking has occurred within the meaning of \\nthe fifth amendment of the United States \\nConstitution. \\n\\n(b) BURDEN OF PROOF.—(1) The Government \\nshall bear the burden of proof in any action \\ndescribed under— \\n\\n(A) subsection (a)(2)(A), with regard to \\nshowing the nexus between the stated gov-\\nernmental purpose of the governmental in-\\nterest and the impact on the proposed use of \\nprivate property; \\n\\n(B) subsection (a)(2)(B), with regard to \\nshowing the proportionality between the ex-\\naction and the impact of the proposed use of \\nthe property; and \\n\\n(C) subsection (a)(2)(C), with regard to \\nshowing that such deprivation of value in-\\nheres in the title to the property. \\n\\n(2) The property owner shall have the bur-\\nden of proof in any action described under \\nsubsection (a)(2)(D), with regard to estab-\\nlishing the diminution of value of property. \\n\\n(c) COMPENSATION AND NUISANCE EXCEPTION \\nTO PAYMENT OF JUST COMPENSATION.—(1) No \\ncompensation shall be required by this Act if \\nthe owner’s use or proposed use of the prop-\\nerty is a nuisance as commonly understood \\nand defined by background principles of nui-\\nsance and property law, as understood within \\nthe State in which the property is situated, \\nand to bar an award of damages under this \\nAct, the United States shall have the burden \\nof proof to establish that the use or proposed \\nuse of the property is a nuisance. \\n\\n(2) Subject to paragraph (1), if an agency \\naction directly takes property or a portion of \\nproperty under subsection (a), compensation \\nto the owner of the property that is affected \\nby the action shall be either the greater of \\nan amount equal to— \\n\\n(A) the difference between— \\n(i) the fair market value of the property or \\n\\nportion of the property affected by agency \\naction before such property became the sub-\\nject of the specific government regulation; \\nand \\n\\n(ii) the fair market value of the property \\nor portion of the property when such prop-\\nerty becomes subject to the agency action; \\nor \\n\\n(B) business losses. \\n(d) TRANSFER OF PROPERTY INTEREST.—The \\n\\nUnited States shall take title to the prop-\\nerty interest for which the United States \\npays a claim under this Act. \\n\\n(e) SOURCE OF COMPENSATION.—The com-\\npensation referred to in this section shall be \\npaid out of funds made available to the Fed-\\neral agency or department by appropriation \\nfor the fiscal year in which the property dep-\\nrivation referred to in this section occurred. \\nIf no such funds have been made available to \\nthe agency, such payment shall be made \\nfrom the Judgment Fund. \\nSEC. 6.

Mr. President, in an un-\\nusual publication called simply ‘‘Con-\\nstitution,’’ published by the Founda-\\ntion for the United States Constitu-\\ntion, there is an article by Professor \\nHarold Hongju Koh of Yale University \\ntitled, ‘‘Bitter Fruit of the Asian Im-\\nmigration Cases.’’ \\n\\nIt interested me because of my long \\nassociation with the cause of civil \\nrights and because I grew up in the \\nState of Oregon and recall the criti-\\ncism my father took when, as a Lu-\\ntheran minister, he objected to the 1942 \\nunconstitutional transfer of Japanese \\nAmerican citizens away from the West \\nCoast. Another reason for my interest \\nis that I serve on the Senate Judi-\\nciary’s Subcommittee on Immigration \\nand Refugee Affairs. \\n\\nOur record in the field of immigra-\\ntion has not always been a good one, \\nand that is particularly true as it ap-\\nplies to the Asian community. \\n\\nThere is no question that we face \\nproblems in the field of immigration, \\nbut the answer is not passing things \\nlike Proposition 187 in California or the \\nother abuses that we have tolerated \\nthrough the history of our country. \\n\\nI believe my colleagues will find the \\narticle by Professor Koh a matter of \\nmore than casual interest. \\n\\nAt this point, I ask that it be printed \\nin the RECORD. \\n\\nThe article follows: \\nBITTER FRUIT OF THE ASIAN IMMIGRATION \\n\\nCASES \\n(By Harold Hongju Koh) \\n\\nSchoolchildren everywhere can recite the \\nStatue of Liberty’s inspirational message \\n\\nabout ‘‘huddled masses, yearning to breathe \\nfree.’’ Yet history shows that our national \\nattitude toward immigrants has been as hos-\\ntile as it has been solicitious—especially in \\nhard times. One need only look at today’s \\nheadlines. As we endure our latest recession, \\nnewspapers report polls showing that 60 per-\\ncent of Americans believe current levels of \\nimmigration are too high. News stories tell \\nof the government’s harsh policies toward \\nHaitian and Chinese refugees, of public con-\\ncern over the illicit smuggling of aliens, of \\nanti-immigrant sentiment spurred by the \\nWorld Trade Center bombing, and of lawsuits \\nbrought by California, Texas and Florida \\nagainst the federal government to recoup \\ncosts arising from the influx of undocu-\\nmented aliens. Politicians, says the New \\nYork Times, call for ‘‘a get-tough effort to \\ncontrol immigration . . . prompted by polls \\nshowing that the issue is gaining an impor-\\ntance among voters . . . increasingly worried \\nabout the economic impact of immigrants \\nand their effect on American culture.’’ \\n\\nNot only is immigrant bashing as Amer-\\nican as apple pie, but bias against immi-\\ngrants has helped shape our constitutional \\nlaw. Occasionally, the bias has been overt: a \\nproposed constitutional amendment, for ex-\\nample, (favored, apparently, by 49 percent of \\nAmericans) would deny citizenship to the \\nAmerican-born children of undocumented \\naliens. And ‘‘reforms’’ that hurt immigrants \\nhave emerged as themes embroidered on Su-\\npreme Court decisions. It has been a long \\ntime since Justice Harry Blackmun led a \\nunanimous Supreme Court to declare that \\n‘‘aliens as a class are a prime example of a \\ndiscrete and insular minority . . . for whom \\n. . . heightened judicial solicitude is appro-\\npriate’’ Graham v. Richardson, 1971). His last \\nmajor immigration opinion Sale v. Haitian \\nCenters Council, 1993) was a solitary dissent \\ndecrying the summary return of Haitian ref-\\nugees to a brutal dictatorship without first \\ngranting them a hearing. In his dissent, \\nBlackmun laid bare the themes that run \\nthrough the modern Court’s immigration \\nand naturalization jurisprudence: an obses-\\nsion with sovereignty and governmental \\npower, an unwillingness to scrutinize the im-\\nmigration decisions of government officials, \\ncontempt for international law and indiffer-\\nence to the due process and equal protection \\nclaims of foreigners seeking entry to the \\nUnited States. \\n\\nWhere and when did these attitudes origi-\\nnate? The latest volume of the Oliver Wen-\\ndell Holmes Devise: History of the Supreme \\nCourt, Owen Fiss’s impressive Troubled Be-\\nginnings of the Modern State, 1888–1910, illu-\\nminates a source: a series of Asian immigra-\\ntion cases decided by the Court in the late \\n19th century. Before these cases, immigra-\\ntion into the United States went virtually \\nunregulated, driven by the perceived need to \\nremedy underpopulation. Indeed, the Dec-\\nlaration of Independence assailed the King of \\nEngland for ‘‘endeavor[ing] to prevent the \\nPopulation of these States; for that Purpose \\nobstructing the Laws for Naturalization of \\nForeigners; [and] refusing to pass others to \\nencourage their Migrations hither. . . .’’ The \\nConstitution’s framers responded with the \\nfourth clause of Article I, Section 8, which \\ngranted Congress power to ‘‘establish an uni-\\nform Rule of Naturalization.’’ In 1790 Con-\\ngress invoked new power to pass a law per-\\nmitting only ‘‘free white persons’’ to natu-\\nralize, a right not granted to Asian immi-\\ngrants until 1952. \\n\\nSignificantly, this language did not au-\\nthorize Congress to regulate the admission of \\naliens who might seek citizenship. In fact, \\nanother clause of Article I forbade Congress \\nto prohibit the ‘‘Migration or Importation of \\nsuch Persons as any of the States now exist-\\ning shall think proper to admit’’ before 1808. \\n\\nDesigned to protect the slave trade, the \\nclause was invoked by Jeffersonians to chal-\\nlenge the constitutionality of the Alien Act \\nof 1798, which authorized the President to \\nexpel ‘‘all such aliens as he shall judge dan-\\ngerous to the peace and safety of the United \\nStates.’’ \\n\\nDuring the years of free immigration few \\nAsians came to these shores. Between 1820, \\nwhen immigration records were first kept, \\nand 1849, when the California Gold Rush \\nbegan, only 43 Chinese were reported to have \\narrived in America. But once gold was dis-\\ncovered, thousands of Chinese miners flooded \\ninto ‘‘Kumshan’’—the Golden Moutain—as \\nthey called California. In 1850, 4,000 Chinese \\narrived in California. The next year the Chi-\\nnese population stood at 25,000; in 1852, 45,000. \\nThese immigrants—mostly men who had left \\ntheir families in China—came to work the \\nmines. But by the mid-1860s, thousands had \\ndepleted their mining claims or been forced \\noff them. They found work on the western \\nslopes of the Sierra Nevada, building the \\nCentral Pacific Railroad; in one year the \\ncompany procured 15,000 laborers. Other Chi-\\nnese opened laundries, restaurants and small \\nshops, or worked as gardeners, domestic \\nservants, farmers, fishermen, mechanics and \\nartisans. By the mid-1870s, some 115,000 Chi-\\nnese lived in the United States, 70 percent in \\nCalifornia, where one person in 10 was Chi-\\nnese. \\n\\nThe first Chinese were welcomed with curi-\\nosity. In 1852 the governor of California \\nclaimed he wanted ‘‘further immigration and \\nsettlement of the Chinese—one of the most \\nworthy classes of our newly adopted citi-\\nzens.’’ But by the 1860s hospitality had \\nsoured. White workers assailed the Chinese \\nfor working too hard for too little, while the \\npopular press vilified them as lairs, crimi-\\nnals, prostitutes and opium addicts. \\n\\nUnlike the European immigrants then \\nflooding into the United States, the Chinese \\nwere thought unassimilable. In Justice Ste-\\nphen Field’s works, ‘‘they remained strang-\\ners in the land, residing apart by themselves, \\nand adhering to the customs and usages of \\ntheir own country. As they grew in numbers \\neach year, the people of the [West] coast saw, \\nor believed they saw . . . great danger that \\nat no distant day that portion of our country \\nwould be overrun by them unless prompt ac-\\ntion was taken to restrict their immigra-\\ntion.’’ When drought and depression hit Cali-\\nfornia in the early 1860s, the Chinese were \\nscapegoated. ‘‘To an American,’’ the 1876 \\nmanifesto of the Workingmen’s Party of \\nCalifornia declared, ‘‘death is preferable to \\nlife on a par with the Chinaman.’’ \\n\\nCalifornia and its cities began to enact re-\\nstrictive laws. The first were revenue meas-\\nures (such as entry, license and occupation \\ntaxes) and other laws neutral on their face \\nbut applied harshly against the Chinese. Chi-\\nnese paid 98 percent of the monies collected \\nunder the California Foreign Miner’s Tax, for \\nexample, and an 1870 law authorizing the \\nstate’s immigration commissioner to remove \\n‘‘debauched women’’ was quickly applied to \\nChinese women arriving by ship. Soon the \\nlaws became overtly racist; a San Francisco \\nordinance required all Chinese residents to \\nmove to prescribed ghettoes, and another hu-\\nmiliated Chinese prisoners in the county jail \\nby requiring them to cut their queues to one \\ninch in length. Between 1855 and 1870 Cali-\\nfornia passed acts bearing such titles as ‘‘An \\nAct to Discourage the Immigration to This \\nState of Persons Who Cannot Become Citi-\\nzens,’’ ‘‘An Act to Protect Free White Labor \\nAgainst Competition with Chinese Coolie \\nLabor’’ and ‘‘An Act to Prevent the Further \\nImmigration of Chinese or Mongolians to \\nThis State.’’ Chinese were denied the vote \\nand the rights to own or inherit land, to tes-\\ntify in court, to attend public schools with \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES570 January 6, 1995 \\nwhites or to live in the same neighborhoods \\nas whites. In 1879 California’s new constitu-\\ntion asserted that ‘‘the presence of for-\\neigners ineligible to become citizens . . . is \\ndangerous to the well-being of the State, and \\nthe Legislature shall discourage their immi-\\ngration by all means within its power.’’ \\n\\nMeanwhile, assaults on the Chinese became \\ncommonplace. In 1871 a Los Angeles race riot \\nkilled 19 Chinese. In September 1885, 28 Chi-\\nnese laborers in a settlement near Rock \\nSprings, Wyoming, were brutally murdered, \\nand vigilantes killed several Chinese resi-\\ndents of the Washington territories. The \\nnext year mobs invaded the Chinese sections \\nof several West Coast cities and forced resi-\\ndents out. Across Washington, Oregon and \\nCalifornia, mass meetings demanded the ex-\\npulsion of Chinese. \\n\\nCalifornia’s restrictiveness contrasted \\nsharply with federal immigration policy. An \\n1868 act of Congress declared that the right \\nto leave the land of one’s birth and resettle \\nelsewhere was ‘‘a natural and inherent right \\nof all people,’’ in recognition of which the \\nUnited states ‘‘has freely received emigrants \\nfrom all nations and invested them with \\nrights of citizenship.’’ That year the United \\nStates and China concluded the Burlingame \\nTreaty to improve trade with China and en-\\ncourage the immigration of coolies to build \\nthe railroads. The treaty recognized that \\nfree migration and an ‘‘inherent and inalien-\\nable right of man to change his home and al-\\nlegiance’’ were matters of ‘‘mutual advan-\\ntage’’ for both nations. by its terms, Chinese \\ncould become ‘‘permanent residents’’ of the \\nUnited States. Federal receptivity extended \\nnot just to immigration but also to citizen-\\nship by birth. In 1866, two years before the \\nBurlingame Treaty, Congress passed a civil \\nrights law (designed to overturn the 1857 \\nDred Scott decision) that reaffirmed the citi-\\nzenship of native-born blacks. Its language \\nwas echoed in the birthright citizenship \\nclause of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, \\nsoon to be drafted by Congress: ‘‘All persons \\nborn or naturalized in the United States and \\nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citi-\\nzens of the United States and of the State \\nwherein they reside.’’ California Senator \\nJohn Conness supported this language and \\ndeclared his desire for equal rights for chil-\\ndren of Chinese parentage. By accepting the \\nclause, notes constitutional scholar Gerald \\nNeuman, Congress ‘‘refused the invitation to \\ncreate an hereditary caste of voteless deni-\\nzens, vulnerable to expulsion and exploi-\\ntation.’’ \\n\\nBut the tide soon changed. In 1872 political \\npressure led President Ulysses S. Grant to \\ncall for legislation to counteract the evils \\nassociated with Chinese immigration. The \\nresulting Immigration Act of 1875 was the \\nfirst federal legislation to control immigra-\\ntion. It outlawed contracts to supply coolie \\nlabor, barred importation of aliens without \\ntheir consent and made it illegal to bring in \\nwomen for purposes of prostitution. As ap-\\nplied against the Chinese, the restrictionist \\nstatute seemed inconsistent with the spirit \\nof the Burlingame Treaty. Four years later \\nPresident Rutherford Hayes invoked the \\ntreaty to veto a bill forbidding ships to bring \\nmore than 15 Chinese at a time into the \\ncountry. But in 1880, under pressure from \\nCongress, Hayes renegotiated the Bur-\\nlingame Treaty to recognize America’s right \\nto regulate, limit and suspend Chinese immi-\\ngration. Two years later Congress enacted \\nthe first Chinese Exclusion Act, which sus-\\npended immigration of Chinese, with minor \\nexceptions, for 10 years. That law was \\namended and reenacted repeatedly and was \\nnot finally revoked until 1943. The 1882 act \\nexpressly prohibited the naturalization of \\nChinese as American citizens and denied \\nentry to the wives of Chinese, even perma-\\n\\nnent U.S. residents—a restriction that con-\\ntinued for the next 60 years. This shortage of \\nwomen forced many Chinese laborers to re-\\nturn to China simply to marry or have fami-\\nlies. In 1884 Congress amended the exclusion \\nlaw to require returning Chinese laborers to \\nproduce certificates of residence signed by \\ntwo non-Chinese American citizens—a req-\\nuisite designed to thwart ‘‘the notorious ca-\\npabilities of the lower classes of Chinese for \\nperjury.’’ \\n\\nThe act was soon challenged. Chae Chan \\nPing, a Chinese laborer who had entered the \\nUnited States lawfully in 1875, obtained the \\nrequired certificate of residence before vis-\\niting China in 1887. In 1888, shortly before he \\nwas to return, Congress amended the Exclu-\\nsion Act to revoke all reentry certificates. \\nChae Chan Ping was denied reentry, and he \\nsued. He challenged the amended Chinese Ex-\\nclusion Act on the grounds that it violated \\nthe Constitution’s due process and equal pro-\\ntection clauses and conflicted with the Bur-\\nlingame Treaty. \\n\\nIn other times his case would have seemed \\neasy. But a unanimous Court rejected his \\nclaim and in the process laid down the five \\nplanks of our modern immigration jurispru-\\ndence. Justice Stephen J. Field wrote the \\nopinion. \\n\\nThe first plank came with Field’s title, the \\nChinese Exclusion case, an inapt name for a \\ncase that actually concerned the reentry of a \\nlongtime resident. By framing the case as an \\nanalysis of the federal government’s sup-\\nposed power to exclude, Field portrayed Chae \\nChan Ping’s claim as an assault on the Chi-\\nnese Exclusion Act, which he defined as the \\nstatutory expression of an inherent, \\nunenumerated foreign-affairs power that lay \\nbeyond substantive constitutional attack. \\nThis power, he said, was an essential feature \\nof national sovereignty. That ‘‘the govern-\\nment of the United States. . .can exclude \\naliens from its territories,’’ he declared, ‘‘is \\na proposition which we do not think open to \\ncontroversy. . .The power of exclusion of for-\\neigners being an incident of sovereignty be-\\nlonging to the government of the United \\nStates, as a part of those sovereign powers \\ndelegated by the Constitution, the right to \\nits exercise at any time, when, in the judg-\\nment of the government, the interests of the \\ncountry require it, cannot be granted away \\nor restrained on behalf of any one.’’ \\n\\nJustice Field conceded that the 1888 act \\nviolated the open terms of the Burlingame \\nTreaty. But, he concluded, the act was ‘‘not \\non that account invalid,’’ since statutes and \\ntreaties are equivalent federal laws, and the \\nmost recent controls. In effect, he suggested, \\nlaying down what became the second plank \\nof the Court’s immigration jurisprudence, \\nCongress has the power not just to disregard \\nbut also to abrogate solemn treaty obliga-\\ntions. \\n\\nThird, Field noted, a Chinese laborer’s \\nright to reenter the United States ‘‘is held at \\nthe will of the government, revocable at any \\ntime, at its pleasure,’’ despite any due proc-\\ness claim. Although the Court did not elabo-\\nrate on that conclusion, later decisions have \\nconstrued it as resting on several implicit \\npremises: that perhaps the Constitution does \\nnot apply to aliens outside the United \\nStates; that a person’s right to return home \\nis neither a ‘‘liberty’’ nor a ‘‘property’’ inter-\\nest protected by constitutional due process; \\nor that an individual’s due process interest \\ncan be outweighed by the public’s interest in \\n‘‘preserv[ing] its independence, and giving] \\nsecurity against foreign aggression and en-\\ncroachment.’’ As the constitutional scholar \\nLouis Henkin has noted, ‘‘whatever the \\nCourt intended, both its holding and its \\nsweeping dictum have been taken to mean \\nthat there are no constitutional limitations \\non the power of Congress to regulate immi-\\ngration.’’ \\n\\nThe fourth plank was an omission. In Yick \\nWo v. Hopkins, decided only three years ear-\\nlier, the Court had held a San Francisco or-\\ndinance invalid under the 14th Amendment, \\nbased on evidence that it was applied \\ndicriminatorily against Chinese launderers. \\nHere the Court never examined whether, by \\nextension, the federal exclusion laws also of-\\nfended the constitutional guarantee of equal \\nprotection of the laws. \\n\\nFinally, Justice Field labeled the govern-\\nment’s actions a ‘‘political question’’ that \\nbarred judicial review. ‘‘Whether a proper \\nconsideration by our government of its pre-\\nvious laws, or a proper respect for the nation \\nwhose subjects are affected by its action, \\nought to have qualified its inhibition and \\nmade it applicable only to persons departing \\nfrom the country after the passage of the act \\nare not questions for judicial determina-\\ntion,’’ he wrote. \\n\\nDuring the next decade the Court expanded \\nupon each principle in a series of Asian im-\\nmigration cases. In Nishimura Ekiu v. United \\nStates (1892), it backed an immigration offi-\\ncial who refused a Japanese woman admis-\\nsion to the United States, relying on a stat-\\nute authorizing such refusal if in the offi-\\ncial’s opinion immigrants were likely to be-\\ncome ‘‘public charges.’’ Justice Horace Gray \\ndelivered the opinion upholding the act, re-\\npeating Field’s language about a sovereign \\nnation’s power to exclude aliens. Since the \\nstatute had granted the officer discretionary \\npower, Gray reasoned, ‘‘no other tri-\\nbunal. . .is at liberty to reexamine or con-\\ntrovert the sufficiency of the evidence on \\nwhich he acted.’’ \\n\\nA year later, in Fong Yue Ting v. United \\nStates (1893), Gray expanded those claims. At \\nissue was whether a Chinese laborer, a U.S. \\nresident for 14 years and, of course, barred \\nfrom becoming a citizen, could be arrested \\nand expelled for lacking a certificate of resi-\\ndence. Based on the testimony of a Chinese \\nwitness, a federal judge had found that the \\nlaborer was a permanent resident of the \\nUnited States. But Gray extended Field’s ar-\\nguments from the Chinese Exclusion case. He \\nrecognized an ‘‘absolute and unqualified’’ \\ngovernmental right not just to exclude \\naliens who have never entered, but ‘‘to expel \\nor deport foreigners, who have not been nat-\\nuralized or taken any step toward becoming \\ncitizens.’’ In an incredible catch–22, Gray \\nturned Fong Yue Ting’s acceptance of a legal \\ndisability (his inability to become a natural-\\nized American citizen) into a justification \\nfor barring him from his adopted home. In so \\ndoing he rejected both due process and equal \\nprotection claims. In Fiss’s words, he left \\n‘‘Yick Wo on the books but denied it any op-\\nerative effect.’’ \\n\\nIn 1895 the Court added the last piece of \\nthe puzzle. Lem Moon Sing, a Chinese drug-\\ngist permanently domiciled in San Fran-\\ncisco, visited his native home. Upon being \\ndenied reentry in 1894, he provided proof of \\nhis prior residence from two credible non- \\nChinese witnesses, but he was nevertheless \\nrestrained and confined. Writing for the \\nCourt, the elder Justice John Marshall Har-\\nlan upheld the denial of Lem Moon Sing’s \\nwrit of habeas corpus, reasoning that a deci-\\nsion of an immigration official to deny an \\nalien admission to the United States could \\nnot be reexamined in a habeas corpus pro-\\nceeding (Lem Moon Sing v. United States). The \\ndecision had two startling results. First, it \\ntransformed the doctrine of plenary federal \\npower over exclusion from a congressional \\npower to an executive authority, once Con-\\ngress had delegated it to executive officials. \\nSecond, the case made clear that courts \\ncould not intervene to examine even blatant \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S571 January 6, 1995 \\nmisuses of the exclusion power by immigra-\\ntion officials. Thus, as this century began, \\nthe Court viewed Congress’s power to control \\nimmigration—nowhere specified in the Con-\\nstitution—as complete, inherent and man-\\ndated by sovereignty and international law. \\nThat power overrode state law, prior treaties \\nand fundamental constitutional protections, \\nand it could be exercised virtually free from \\njudicial scrutiny. \\n\\nA doctrine so sweeping attracted criticism. \\nThe extension of the power to exclude, grant-\\ned in Chinese Exclusion, to deportation and \\nexpulsion proved too much even for Justice \\nField, who not only dissented but also wrote \\na letter urging that additional members be \\nadded to the Court, reasoning that ‘‘where \\n[a] decision goes to the very essentials of \\nConstitutional Government, the question of \\nan increase of the bench may properly be \\nconsidered and acted upon.’’ But as Fiss re-\\nveals, the one consistent and enlightened \\ncritic of the Asian immigration decisions \\nwas Field’s nephew, Justice David Brewer, \\nwho dissented in Nishimura Ekiu, Fong Yue \\nTing and Lem Moon Sing, showing the kind of \\nclarity and inde pendence of mind that \\nmarked him as the Blackmun of his day. The \\nson of missionary parents in Asia Minor, \\nBrewer was one of the few Justices who \\nsought to understand the role of aliens in the \\nconstitutional community. In his Fong Yue \\nTing dissent, he highlighted the racist char-\\nacter of the law in question, asking, ‘‘In view \\nof this enactment of the highest legislative \\nbody of the foremost Christian nation, may \\nnot the thoughtful Chinese disciple of Confu-\\ncius fairly ask, Why do they send mission-\\naries here?’’ \\n\\nFor all his enlightenment, even Brewer did \\nnot argue that the Constitution’s protec-\\ntions applied outside the United States. To \\nthe contrary, his Fong Yue Ting dissent de-\\nclared that ‘‘the Constitution has no \\nextraterritorial effect, and those who have \\nnot come lawfully within our territory can-\\nnot claim any protection from its provi-\\nsions.’’ Years later the Court would exploit \\nthat loophole by creating a legal fiction— \\nthat even aliens who have physically entered \\nthe United States remain legally outside it, \\nthereby intentionally denying even longtime \\nresidents of this country meaningful con-\\nstitutional protection. \\n\\nAs the century turned, the question of \\nwhether aliens outside the United States \\nhave constitutional rights was absorbed by \\nthe larger issue of ‘‘whether the Constitution \\nfollows the flag’’—that is, whether the Con-\\nstitution extends to the furthest reaches of \\nthe emerging American empire. The char-\\nacteristic executive-branch response to this \\nquestion, ascribed by Fiss to Secretary of \\nWar Elihu Root, was, ‘‘As near as I can make \\nout the Constitution follows the flag—but \\ndoesn’t quite catch up with it.’’ \\n\\nOnly one decision ran against the anti- \\nAsian tide: United States v. Wong Kim Ark \\n(1898). That case asked whether children born \\nin the United States of Chinese parents be-\\ncame American citizens by virtue of the 14th \\nAmendments birthright citizenship clause. \\nGiven the earlier Chinese decisions, the case \\nseemed an uphill struggle. The Chinese Ex-\\nclusion Act had denied Wong Kim Ark’s par-\\nents the opportunity for citizenship through \\nnaturalization, and Chae Chan Ping and \\nFong Yue Ting had settled that those par-\\nents could have been deported, expelled or \\nforbidden reentry upon leaving the country. \\nJustice Gray began inauspiciously, asserting \\nthat ‘‘the inherent right of every inde-\\npendent nation to determine for itself, and \\naccording to its own constitution and laws, \\nwhat classes of persons shall be entitled to \\nits citizenship. ‘‘Yet surprisingly, he went on \\nto hold that the 14th Amendment denied the \\nfederal government the power to withhold \\n\\ncitizenship from children born in the United \\nStates of alien parents. \\n\\nThe decision rested on the birthright citi-\\nzenship clause, which confers citizenship on \\nU.S.-born persons of parents ‘‘subject to \\n[U.S.] jurisdiction.’’ The Court’s holding that \\nChinese parents of American-born children \\nwere so subject reaffirmed the themes of sov-\\nereignty and absolute territorial jurisdiction \\nthat ran through the earlier Chinese cases. \\nIronically, the decision also seems to have \\nbeen driven by the potential impact of a con-\\ntrary holding on ethnic groups other than \\nAsians. As Justice Gray noted, ‘‘To hold that \\nthe 14th Amendment . . . excludes from citi-\\nzenship the children born in the United \\nStates of citizens or subjects of other coun-\\ntries, would be to deny citizenship of thou-\\nsands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, \\nGerman, or other European parentage, who \\nalways have been considered a citizens of the \\nUnited States. \\n\\nAll this might seem like ancient history, \\nmade irrelevant by the New Deal, the Warren \\ncourt, the Bill of Rights revolution and the \\nglobal era of international human rights. \\nNor does it seem plausible that blatantly \\nracist laws could survive after Brown v. \\nBoard of Education, the end of official racial \\ndiscrimination and the advent of strict judi-\\ncial scrutiny. But our government’s position \\nin recent cases reveals that immigration is \\ncaught in a time warp. \\n\\nChinese refugees, arriving on Long Island’s \\nsouth shore aboard the Golden Venture, fall \\nsquarely within the Chinese Exclusion hold-\\ning. Poor black Haitian boat people, fleeing \\npersecution after a coup d’état overthrew \\ntheir first democratically elected govern-\\nment, encounter as obstacles to their entry \\ninto the United States claims of inherent \\nsovereignty and plenary congressional \\npower, allegedly delegated to the President \\nand the Coast Guard. Haitians who raise due \\nprocess and equal protection claims are told \\nthat the Constitution does not protect them \\non the high seas. Their efforts to invoke \\nmultilateral and bilateral refugee treaties \\nsimilarly founder on American claims of \\nterritoriality. When Haitians challenge their \\nsummary repatriation to Haiti, our govern-\\nment in its defense cites grounds of foreign \\npolicy, national security and non-\\nreviewability. Refused admission as public \\ncharges and health risks, HIV-positive Hai-\\ntian asylum seekers are detained for nearly \\ntwo years in a U.S. government internment \\ncamp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in an eerie \\nparallel of the government’s internment of \\nJapanese-Americans during World War II. At \\nthis writing, thousands of Haitians are again \\ndetained at Guantanamo. Ironically, the \\nquestion arises whether Haitian children \\nborn in the Guantanamo camp are Haitian, \\nCuban or perhaps even American citizens. \\n\\nOther infamous decisions from the 19th \\ncentury, such as Dred Scott and Plessy v. \\nFerguson (which legalized separate but \\nequal), have been overruled, both at law and \\nin the court of public opinion. But the Asian \\nimmigration cases of that era—no less \\nshocking—still bear bitter fruit. Today, no \\npublic official would embrace the racism, ha-\\ntred and nativism that drove those decisions. \\nYet the legal principles they enunciated still \\nrule our borders.∑ \\n\\nf \\n\\nTRITUTE TO GORO HOKAMA \\n\\n∑ Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have \\nknown Goro Hokama, the outgoing \\nchairman of the county council of the \\nCounty of Maui, for over 40 years. In \\nthe spring of 1954, I recall meeting with \\nhim to discuss whether we should con-\\nsider public service as our life’s career. \\n\\nFor 40 years, Goro Hokama has served \\nthe people of Maui County as a member \\nof the county council and also chair-\\nman of that same body. \\n\\nI wish to share with you and my col-\\nleagues the following editorial from \\nthe Maui News, dated December 20, \\n1994, entitled ‘‘Goro Hokama: 40 Years \\nof Service.’’ \\n\\nI believe it expresses the sentiment \\nof many of us who have had the privi-\\nlege of calling him friend, and the \\nmany who have benefited form his \\nleadership. I wish to join the people of \\nMaui County and all of Hawaii in com-\\nmending and thanking Goro Hokama \\nfor his 40 years of dedicated public \\nservice. \\n\\nThe editorial follows: \\n[From the Maui News, Dec. 20, 1994] \\nGORO HOKAMA: 40 YEARS OF SERVICE \\n\\n1994’s end will officially bring down the \\ncurtain on Goro Hokama’s 40 continuous \\nyears of public service to Maui County. It’s \\nimpossible to overstate the contributions he \\nhas made to this community, and in fact, to \\nthe entire state of Hawaii. \\n\\nThe departing Maui County Council chair-\\nman was first elected to office in 1954, the \\nyear of the great political revolution that \\nsaw the Democrats snatch the reins of power \\nfrom the Republicans and by proxy from the \\nbig landowners. Hokama was Hawaii’s lone \\nremaining elected county official who had a \\nhand in that historic housecleaning, a stay-\\ning power made ever more remarkable by his \\nhaving to face election every two years. \\n\\nU.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye is the only person \\nremaining from the 1954 sweep who has \\nserved in elected office as long as Hokama, \\nbut even he did not have to win 20 straight \\ntimes to do so. Hokama did. \\n\\nAnd Hokama won without ever sacrificing \\nhis principles, even when it meant risking \\nthe loss of longtime supporters. For all of his \\n40 years on the County Council, or its prede-\\ncessor, the Board of Supervisors, Hokama \\nheld the Lanai residency seat. In more than \\none election he trailed his opponent when \\nthe ballots on Lanai were counted, but with \\ncountywide voting he would prevail anyway \\nbecause of his broad appeal to residents \\nthroughout the county. \\n\\nSeeing himself as more than just a Lanai \\ncouncilman, Hokama clearly understood his \\nrole as a county councilman, and his actions \\nreflected that understanding, even if not al-\\nways to his benefit back home. \\n\\nHe learned early, however, not to be fright-\\nened off by the odds, working as a union or-\\nganizer among the pineapple workers on \\nLanai in the 1940s when unions were a poison \\nto the ruling political and financial powers. \\nAnd neither was he frightened off nearly 50 \\nyears later when the ILWU shockingly re-\\nfused to endorse him, one of its own, in the \\nelection of 1992 because of differences he had \\nwith the union leadership over the course of \\ndevelopment on Lanai. \\n\\nHe won anyway. \\nThat was an occasion when he opposed de-\\n\\nvelopment, and he drew the wrath of labor. \\nOn other occasions he supported develop-\\nment, and he drew the wrath of environ-\\nmentalists. On all of those occasions, how-\\never, Hokama acted upon what he believed \\nwas right, not on what may have been politi-\\ncally expedient. \\n\\nMaui has repeatedly been cited by econo-\\nmists as the county with the firmest finan-\\ncial footing in the state, and that is due in \\nno small part to Goro Hokama.

That economic \\nsuccess story is certainly his chief legacy. \\n\\nHis first and only election loss came in No-\\nvember when his bid for mayor was turned \\nback by Linda Crockett Lingle. Hokama \\nagain found himself bucking the odds by tak-\\ning on the popular Republican incumbent, \\nbut as always he showed his resolve not to be \\ncowed by the odds. He waged an aggressive \\nand tireless campaign from day one, the only \\ndifference being that this time he lost. \\n\\nThat he didn’t lose in any of the 20 elec-\\ntions before this one is both a tribute to the \\nman Goro Hokama and a profit to the Coun-\\nty of Maui.∑ \\n\\nf \\n\\nSTAR WARS OR MAGINOT LINE? \\nCONTRACT TO BANKRUPT AMER-\\nICA \\n\\n∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Re-\\npublican contract calls for the old star \\nwars program—the strategic defense \\ninitiative [SDI]—to be retooled, rein-\\nvigorated, and deployed ‘‘at the ear-\\nliest possible date.’’ We have spent a \\nfortune on this program since 1983, \\nwith next to nothing to show for it, ex-\\ncept perhaps how wasteful and foolish \\nour defense spending can sometimes be. \\n\\nThe following article, written by \\nRobert Wright in the New Republic in \\nDecember 1994, makes a clear case for \\ndiscontinuing the high levels of treas-\\nure we spend on missile defense every \\nyear. President Clinton, who seems in-\\ntent on spending far too much on de-\\nfense over the next few years, must \\nknow that the new threats to our na-\\ntional security cannot be parried by \\nbuilding fanciful, expensive, uncertain \\nmissile defenses. \\n\\nThe President and Congress instead \\nought to acknowledge that SDI by any \\nname remains nothing more than a \\n1990’s version of the old French Magi-\\nnot Line. The Maginot Line didn’t \\nwork in World War I, and star wars \\ncan’t work today, for reasons made \\nclear over the past 10 years of congres-\\nsional and public debate. Sadly, we are \\nvisiting an issue now that should have \\ngone away in the late 1980’s. \\n\\nI commend the New Republic article \\nto my colleagues, and I ask that it be \\nprinted in the RECORD. \\n\\nThe article follows: \\nCRAZY STATE \\n\\n(By Robert Wright) \\n\\nGingrich argued that conservatives adopt \\nspace exploration and Reagan’s Strategic De-\\nfense Initiative, the so-called Star Wars pro-\\ngram, as causes for tactical political gain. \\n‘‘Young people like space,’’ he said.—The \\nWashington Post, 1985) \\n\\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative is back. \\nIt’s right there in the Republicans’ Contract \\nwith America—or, at least, in the exegesis. \\nThe National Security Restoration Act, one \\nof ten bills the contract would bring to a \\nvote by spring, demands ‘‘deployment at the \\nearliest possible date’’ of an anti-ballistic \\nmissile defense. The Republicans haven’t \\nsaid whether that means a space-based de-\\nfense or a land-based defense. Either way it \\nmeans trashing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Mis-\\nsile Treaty, upping Pentagon spending by \\nseveral billion a year for research and upping \\nit by much more when deployment starts. \\nWhy aren’t you excited? \\n\\nA surprisingly large number of people are. \\nThe new SDI comes with a new post-cold war \\nrationale that has attracted not just Repub-\\nlicans, but some centrist Democrats. Indeed, \\nresearch for a land-based SDI has stayed \\nalive—if barely, and under another name— \\nduring the Clinton administration. Acceler-\\nated research and early deployment are thus \\na real political possibility, even if space- \\nbased weapons are a long shot. But before we \\nmake that leap, could somebody explain why \\nthe post-cold war rationale deserves any-\\nthing less than the derision that finally \\noverwhelmed the cold war rationale? \\n\\nThe cold war derision had two pillars. \\nFirst, there were firm doubts about technical \\nfeasibility. Nothing has since happened to \\nundermine them. The Pentagon’s initial \\nclaim of a 96 percent success rate for the Pa-\\ntriot Missile against Iraqi Scuds turned out \\nto be fantasy. \\n\\nSecond, we realized that plain old deter-\\nrence worked just fine as a missile defense; \\nso long as Leonid Brezhnev could count on \\ntit for tat, he wouldn’t attack. If anything, \\nindeed, a missile defense could weaken the \\nperverse logic behind deterrence by making \\nmutually assured destruction less assured; \\nthe ‘‘protected’’ nation might feel too nervy \\nand the unprotected nation too nervous. \\n\\nNow, all of a sudden, we’re told that deter-\\nrence won’t work. Why? Because now we face \\nnot coolly rational, game-theoretical Sovi-\\nets, but a different class of enemy: ‘‘rogue \\nstates’’—Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, Kim Jong \\nIl’s North Korea, Muammar Qaddafi’s Libya. \\nHow does one qualify as a ‘‘rogue state’’? So \\nfar as I can tell, it helps if your leader (a) \\ndoesn’t have white skin, (b) dislikes the \\nUnited States and (c) does not behave in gen-\\nteel fashion (often failing, for example, to \\nwear a necktie during affairs of state). The \\nless polite term for ‘‘rogue state,’’ and its \\nreal meaning, is ‘‘crazy state.’’ But there is \\nzero evidence that any of these leaders is \\n‘‘crazy’’ in the relevant sense: suicidal. Quite \\nthe contrary. Ronald Reagan gave Qaddafi \\nthe litmus test for sanity and he passed: we \\nbombed his house, and he modified his behav-\\nior. Hussein has shown repeatedly that, once \\nhe knows where the brink is, he doesn’t step \\nover it. \\n\\nBear in mind that a nuclear attack on the \\nUnited States would be more suicidal for \\nthese men than it would have been for the \\nSoviets. Brezhnev might conceivably have \\nweathered a firestorm and emerged from his \\nbunker to inherit a world destroyed. If Sad-\\ndam Hussein tried that, he would be \\nsquashed like a bug upon emerging. And he \\nknows it. \\n\\nBesides, if any ‘‘crazy’’ leader does want to \\nblow up an American city, there are SDI- \\nproof ways: drive a bomb across the Mexican \\nborder, sail it up the Potomac on a yacht or \\nmail it. For a seventy-pound package, sec-\\nond-day UPS costs less than a ballistic mis-\\nsile. \\n\\nNeo-SDI advocates also invoke fear of ‘‘ac-\\ncidental launch.’’ But, as John Pike of the \\nFederation of American Scientists has writ-\\nten in this magazine, ‘‘Lots of things have to \\nhappen for a missile to fire. The chances of \\nits leaping unbidden from its silo are about \\nthe same as the chances of a car starting \\nitself up, opening the garage door and back-\\ning out into the driveway without human as-\\nsistance.’’ Besides, how many missiles are \\naimed at America these days? Russia has \\nagreed to point no missiles at us in exchange \\nfor our reciprocal pledge. And whether or not \\nyou trust the Russians, their own strategic \\nlogic argues increasingly for aiming else-\\nwhere (e.g., at other former Soviet states). \\nSimilarly, North Korea’s top two targets \\nwould be South Korea and Japan. That’s the \\nway tensions are in the post-cold war world: \\nregionalized. The surest American defense \\n\\nagainst ‘‘accidental launch’’ is to stay on \\ngood terms with Brazil. \\n\\nOf course, however slight the chances of \\nnuclear attack, and however real the chances \\nthat a missile defense would fail to repel it, \\na little insurance would be appealing if it \\nwere cheap enough. First of all, it isn’t cheap \\n($50 billion assuming meager cost overruns). \\nMoreover, ‘‘insurance’’ conduces to sol-\\nipsism; if we feel (however falsely) safe in-\\nside our little shell, waning support for \\ninternationalism will wane even faster. \\n\\nI’m not saying the new SDI enthusiasm is \\ndriven by nascent Republican isolationism. \\nBut the enthusiasm accommodates and nour-\\nishes the party’s isolationist strain. In the \\nRepublican summary of the Security Res-\\ntoration Act, only one goal gets more promi-\\nnent billing than SDI: ‘‘to ensure that U.S. \\ntroops are only deployed to support missions \\nin the U.S.’s national security interests.’’ \\n\\nWe all care about ‘‘national security inter-\\nests.’’ But some of us think that national se-\\ncurity (in various senses) is increasingly tied \\nto global stability. The Republicans’ post- \\nelection rhetoric, in contrast, fixates on \\nkeeping U.S. troops out of peacekeeping \\nroles, keeping U.S. dollars from supporting \\nother peacekeepers and stifling the foreign \\naid that helps stabilize places like Russia \\nand the Middle East. \\n\\nAlso, of course, the Republicans don’t \\nfavor one-worldish projects like . . . well, \\nlike continued adherence to the 1972 ABM \\nTreaty. And violating that treaty (which, \\nalas, even the Clinton administration’s bat-\\ntlefield missile-defense research program \\nthreatens to do) is itself a dangerous retreat \\nfrom internationalism. What’s scarier than \\nan Indian-Pakistani border flanked by nu-\\nclear arsenals? An Indian-Pakistani border \\nflanked by destabilizing ABMs as well. We \\nmight yet be able to head that prospect off, \\nbut not once we’ve built our own shell. \\n\\nThe United States is now uniquely posi-\\ntioned to lead the world in avoiding two bad \\nthings: a global race to build destabilizing \\nmissile defense systems, and a global race to \\ncarry destabilizing weapons into space—not \\njust anti-missile weapons, but anti-satellite \\nweapons. The Republicans are now on record \\nas wanting to start the first of these races, \\nand they are clearly inclined to start the \\nsecond. It’s time for President Clinton to \\ncrawl out of his bomb shelter, survey the \\nwreckage and start fighting.∑ \\n\\nf \\n\\nPERES ON DESALINATION \\n\\n∑ Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, we are \\nslowly but solidly making progress to \\nreduce television entertainment vio-\\nlence in our country. \\n\\nWe still have a long way to go, but I \\ncame across an Associated Press item \\nreporting that even in Great Britain, \\nwhich has much stricter standards on \\ntelevision violence than we do, there is \\nconcern about television violence. \\n\\nI thought my colleagues might be in-\\nterested in the Associated Press story \\nabout violence on British television \\nand some of the things that are hap-\\npening there. \\n\\nI ask that the Associated Press arti-\\ncle be printed in the RECORD at this \\npoint. \\n\\nThe article follows: \\nBRITAIN JOINS AMERICANS IN ATTACKING TV \\n\\nVIOLENCE \\nLONDON.—British television concerned over \\n\\nthe soaring number of violent crimes in Brit-\\nain, is moving to cut down on the amount of \\nviolence and brutality shown on TV screens \\nhere. \\n\\nBoth the British Broadcasting Corp. and \\nthe Independent Television Commission an-\\nnounced changes last week. \\n\\nThe ITC told commercial TV companies to \\ncut the amount of violence they screen and \\nsaid they will be monitored to ensure they \\ncomply. \\n\\nAmong competitor BBC’s revised guide-\\nlines for programmers: \\n\\nViewers should be given more information \\nabout what programs contain before screen-\\ning, so they can switch off if they wish. \\n\\nProgrammers should have sharper aware-\\nness of portrayals of sexual violence and vio-\\nlence against women. \\n\\nU.S. programmers face a similar battle. \\nThe four U.S. broadcast networks, hoping to \\nhead off government intervention, have \\nagreed to air parental warnings before cer-\\ntain shows. \\n\\nThe BBC included no enforcement provi-\\nsions in its guidelines. But as a private net-\\nwork, financed by license fees paid by view-\\ners, it could simply edit out offending seg-\\nments or censor entire programs. \\n\\nCompanies who ignore the ITC guidelines \\ncan be reprimanded or fined. The commis-\\nsion, established by Act of Parliament, regu-\\nlates Britain’s Independent Television net-\\nwork. \\n\\nDavid Glencross, chief executive of the ITC \\nsaid in announcing ITC guidelines Thursday. \\n‘‘What we are seeing is a public revulsion \\n\\nagainst violence in society which is feeding \\nthrough to a desire for greater sensitivity by \\nTV programmakers and the makers of films \\nand videos.’’ \\n\\nITC guidelines tell program-makers to con-\\nsider carefully in each case whether violent \\nscenes are justified. \\n\\nProgrammers should not look at violent \\nscenes in isolation but consider the accumu-\\nlation of such scenes on viewers. \\n\\nProgram-makers should avoid program-\\nming which ‘‘appears to promote violence as \\na solution to problems or difficulties.’’ \\n\\nIn the area of news, the guidelines note \\nthat ‘‘violent images are becoming increas-\\ningly available to news editors’’ and said TV \\nnews bulletins should take account of the \\ntime they are to be shown. \\n\\nThe ITC guidelines say no proof exists that \\nviolence on TV encourages violent crime in \\nreal life but state: \\n\\n‘‘Caution is required in the television por-\\ntrayal of violence, given concern about the \\nlevel of violence in society and the possi-\\nbility of behavior or attitudes being influ-\\nenced by what is shown on television. Broad-\\ncasters should therefore be especially vigi-\\nlant about the amount of violence in their \\nprograms.’’ \\n\\nWill Wyatt, managing director of BBC net-\\nwork TV, said in announcing the BBC guide-\\nlines, ‘‘We must ensure that where violent \\nscenes—in fictional programs or in news cov-\\nerage—are felt to be editorially necessary, \\nthey are included only after careful and de-\\ntailed consideration. \\n\\n‘‘Although we cannot control what happens \\nin the home, we must ensure that before ma-\\nterial is transmitted it is tested for suit-\\nability for the time and place of its trans-\\nmission—or whether it should be trans-\\nmitted at all.’’∑ \\n\\nf \\n\\nIN DEFIANCE OF DARWIN \\n\\n∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, no one \\ndoubts that the schools in our Nation \\nshould do better. What is still not \\nwidely known is that we really do un-\\nderstand how to do better, but we’re \\nnot applying the knowledge we have. \\n\\nEducation simply has not become \\nenough of a priority. Those of us in \\npublic life talk a good game, but too \\nfew of us do anything about it. \\n\\nAn illustration of what can happen is \\nan article that appeared several weeks \\nago in Newsweek magazine titled ‘‘In \\nDefiance of Darwin,’’ written by \\nLynnell Hancock. \\n\\nI ask that the article be printed in \\nthe RECORD at this point. \\n\\nThe article follows: \\n[From Newsweek, Oct. 24, 1994] \\n\\nIN DEFIANCE OF DARWIN—HOW A PUBLIC \\nSCHOOL IN THE BRONX TURNS DROPOUTS \\nINTO SCHOLARS \\n\\n(By Lynnell Hancock) \\nIt’s a notorious corner in the South \\n\\nBronx—once a grand address, now the hub of \\nthe nation’s poorest neighborhood. Today, at \\n149th Street and the Grand Concourse, a pub-\\nlic high school for at-risk children defies \\nDarwin on a daily basis. Inside Hostos-Lin-\\ncoln Academy of Science, a class of seniors \\ngrapples with ‘‘The Seafarer,’’ an Old \\nEnglish poem about danger, survival and des-\\ntiny. None of these teenagers was expected \\nto ever navigate into the treacherous pages \\nof medieval lit. In fact, their eight-grade \\ncounselors had written off most of them as \\nprobable dropouts, based on low reading \\nscores and spotty attendance. That’s how \\nthey landed at Hostos. Now, after four years \\n\\nhere, more than 80 percent are headed for \\ncollege. And they engage in a lively discus-\\nsion about the sailor who believes his immi-\\nnent death at sea is a stark inevitability, \\nwritten in foam. ‘‘The Anglo-Saxons thought \\nevery person’s fate was predetermined,’’ the \\nteacher, Vincent Sottile, reminds the class. \\n‘‘But we know we have to help ourselves.’’ \\n\\nThese 300 black and Latino students pro-\\nvide the basis for a strong retort to ‘‘The \\nBell Curve.’’ Richard Herrnstein and Charles \\nMurray argue that IQ is largely genetic and \\nthat low IQ means scant success in society. \\nTherefore, they contend, neither effective \\nschools nor a healthier environment can do \\nmuch to alter a person’s destiny. Yet, at \\nHostos, reading scores nearly doubled over \\ntwo years. The dropout rate is low, and at-\\ntendance is high. About 70 percent of the \\nclass of 1989 graduated on time, double the \\ncity’s average. Among last year’s graduates, \\none was accepted at Columbia University’s \\nSchool of Engineering. Others are attending \\nFordham University and Hamilton College. \\n\\nHostos was established by the city seven \\nyears ago for South Bronx children who live \\n‘‘stressing lives,’’ as one student puts it, in \\nbroken families and dangerous neigh \\nborhoods that offer only huge, anonymous \\npublic schools. Hostos is small, attentive to \\nindividual students, and demanding. To en-\\nsure that no child goes astray, one teacher is \\nassigned for four years to the same home-\\nroom class, which combines lessons in rudi-\\nmentary social skills with those in computer \\nand civics. Most students take honors and \\neven college-level courses. ‘‘We threw out \\nthe Mickey Mouse curriculum and intro-\\nduced [University of the State of New York] \\nRegents-level courses,’’ said Dr. Michele \\nCataldi, Hostos’s founder and principal. \\nWhere students once had business math, \\nthey now have trigonometry. ‘‘At first we \\nfelt students couldn’t do it, but we were \\nwrong,’’ says Cataldi. Teachers worked over-\\ntime to provide intensive one-on-one tutor-\\ning. The results were impressive. The num-\\nber of students in each class who passed the \\nstate’s regents biology test rose from 9 to 50 \\npercent in two years. ‘‘You have to believe in \\nthem,’’ says Donna Light-Donovan, a biology \\nteacher. ‘‘Most kids don’t have anyone at \\nhome who does.’’ \\n\\nStanley Mustafa is one student who found \\na haven at Hostos. A few years ago he was \\nstabbed on the street by a neighborhood \\nteen. His life was saved by a trauma surgeon. \\nThat’s the profession he now expects to enter \\nsome day. ‘‘It made me grow up faster,’’ says \\nMustafa, 17, dressed in baggy jeans and an \\noversize Black Sheep T shirt. ‘‘I don’t want \\nto end up on the corner, hanging with the \\nhomeboys.’’ He takes chemistry and cellular \\nbiology at Hostos, studies radiology at a \\nlocal hospital and hopes to attend Atlanta’s \\nMorehouse School of Medicine or the Univer-\\nsity of Virginia. \\n\\nNationwide, more and more districts are \\nestablishing small ‘‘restructured’’ schools \\nlike Hostos that stress team teaching, a \\nfamilylike environment and high expecta-\\ntions. New York City has more than 35 of \\nthem, with plans for about 50 more. \\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that 30 years of \\nsuch experimental schools for disadvantaged \\nchildren have shown paltry improvements, \\nand that federal money should be funneled \\naway from them, and toward schools for the \\n‘‘cognitive elite.’’ But a new study com-\\nparing 820 high schools—some big and tradi-\\ntional, others small and cooperative—proves \\notherwise. From eighth to 10th grade, stu-\\ndents in the restructured schools showed 30 \\npercent higher gains in math and 24 percent \\nhigher gains in reading compared with stu-\\ndents in traditional schools. \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES574 January 6, 1995 \\nHIGH EXPECTATIONS \\n\\nThe study, commissioned by the Center on \\nOrganization and Restructuring of Schools \\nat the University of Wisconsin in Madison, \\nalso found that the gap between the poor and \\nthose who were not poor shrank in the more \\nnurturing schools. ‘‘When high expectations \\nfor student learning are embodied in the for-\\nmal structure of the school, very positive ef-\\nfects can occur for at-risk youth,’’ says An-\\nthony Bryk, director of the University of \\nChicago’s Center for School Improvement, \\none of the report’s analysts. \\n\\nYet in ‘‘The Bell Curve’’ scenario, most \\nHostos students would give up their goals \\nand find a valued place in society’’ back in \\nthe South Bronx. ‘‘The idea that people with \\nthe most capacity to be educated should be-\\ncome the most educated sounds dangerously \\nelitist,’’ they write.

Mr. President, I picked \\nup the fall 1994 issue of the publication, \\nConstitution put out twice a year by \\nthe Foundation for the U.S. Constitu-\\ntion in New York City. \\n\\nThe chairman of the foundation is \\nDwayne O. Andreas, the chief executive \\nofficer of Archer Daniels Midland \\n[ADM] and a public-spirited citizen \\nwho has been willing to come to the \\nfore on many key national concerns. \\n\\nI opened the magazine to read a pre-\\namble by Dwayne Andreas, and it is so \\nloaded with common sense that I ask \\nthat it be inserted into the CONGRES-\\nSIONAL RECORD at the end of my re-\\nmarks. \\n\\nDemocracy can prevail only if citi-\\nzens exercise self-restraint. We cannot \\nsee how close to the edge of the cliff we \\ncan come in exercising our freedoms. \\n\\nWhat Dwayne Andreas calls civic re-\\nsponsibility is the obligation of those \\nof us in public office and of all Amer-\\nican citizens. \\n\\nAn item he refers to later in the pub-\\nlication is good but is, frankly, not as \\npointed as the Dwayne Andreas com-\\nment. \\n\\nI urge my colleagues and their staffs \\nto read Dwayne Andreas’s comments, \\nwhich follows. At this point, I ask that \\nMr. Andreas’s statement be printed in \\nthe RECORD. \\n\\nThe statement follows: \\nThe rights we enjoy as American citizens \\n\\nhave been a central focus of Constitution \\nsince we began publishing the magazine in \\n1988. In this issue we present a Special Re-\\nport in which we consider the other side of \\nthe contract: the obligations of citizens to \\ntheir society. \\n\\nThese days, I sometimes wonder whether \\nthere is a contract—whether we Americans \\nrecognize any limits on our freedom to do as \\nwe please. We seem to have forgotten that \\nthe Constitution guarantees our rights with-\\nin society. Increasingly, individuals and \\ngroups manifest a kind of ‘‘in your face’’ \\ncontempt for the rights of their fellow citi-\\nzens; social obligations take a back seat to \\npersonal fulfillment and economic gain. \\n\\nNowhere is this lack of civility more evi-\\ndent than in the area of social expression \\n\\nprotected by the First Amendment to the \\nConstitution. Brutality, obscenity and raw \\nsex have become the common coin of tele-\\nvision, film and popular music; all who ques-\\ntion the fitness of these materials for a gen-\\nerally youthful audience are derided as \\nprudes or thought controllers. And the pur-\\nveyors of this destructive effluvium assert \\ntheir right to sell it; few dare to speak of so-\\nciety’s right to resist the tide. \\n\\nBut society does have that right, and I fear \\nthat those who abuse the First Amendment \\nin this way may be endangering the splendid \\nguarantee that has protected them for so \\nlong. Even sober commentators like Irving \\nKristol worry about whether the First \\nAmendment can survive. Writing for the wall \\nStreet Journal not long ago, Kristol labeled \\ntelevision violence a form of child abuse and \\nsuggested that ‘‘modest limits on adult lib-\\nerties ought to be perfectly acceptable if \\nthey prevent tens of thousands of children \\nfrom growing up into criminal adults.’’ \\n\\nAre such legislated limits truly necessary? \\nI don’t think so. Rather what’s required is \\nrecalling that there is such a thing as civic \\nresponsibility—that with the rights of citi-\\nzenship go some obligations. To remind read-\\ners of these obligations, we have prepared \\nthe Special Report that begins on page 50. \\nThese pages carry a timely reminder. Ignor-\\ning it could menace the guarantees about \\nwhich this magazine has written so much \\nsince it was founded six years ago.∑ \\n\\nf \\n\\nSENATORS DOLE AND DASCHLE \\nMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as \\n\\nwe all know, the 104th Congress con-\\nvened Wednesday and before we become \\ntoo immersed in the legislative proc-\\ness, I want to take a moment to recog-\\nnize the two leaders who will guide us \\nthrough the next 2 years. \\n\\nIt has been my experience that some \\nof the key qualities of a good leader are \\ndecisiveness, ability, commitment, in-\\ntegrity, and moral and physical cour-\\nage. The new majority leader, Senator \\nROBERT DOLE, posses those attributes \\nand many more, and I am proud to call \\nhim my friend. \\n\\nBOB’S commitment to public service \\nbegan in 1943 when he raised his right \\nhand and enlisted in the U.S. Army as \\nWorld War II raged at its height. A nat-\\nural leader, young G.I. DOLE soon \\nearned a commission and found himself \\ncommanding a platoon in the famed \\n10th Mountain Division, which remains \\none of the Army’s premiere combat \\nunits. During bloody and vicious fight-\\ning against the Germans in the rugged \\nterrain of Italy, BOB was severely \\nwounded twice and very nearly lost his \\nlife. Though decorated for his valorous \\nacts in battle, Senator DOLE carries \\nwith him to this day a very noticeable \\nreminder of the cost of liberty and of \\nwarfare. I am sure that each of use rec-\\nognizes the disability that BOB has \\novercome as a reminder that war, or \\nthe employment of military force, is \\nnot a matter to be considered lightly, \\nand that whenever young Americans \\nare placed in harm’s way, they run the \\nrisk of being killed, wounded, or \\nmaimed. \\n\\nIn 1951 BOB was elected to the Kansas \\nState legislature, beginning a career \\nthat ultimately brought him to this \\nChamber. His time in the statehouse \\n\\nwas quickly followed by a term as \\ncounty attorney and then four terms in \\nthe U.S. House of Representatives. In \\n1968, BOB came to the U.S. Senate and \\nit was immediately apparent to me \\nthat he was a man destined to go \\nplaces. In the ensuring 27 years, I have \\nbeen pleased and proud to watch BOB’S \\ncareer progress, as he served as the \\nchairman of the Republican National \\nCommittee; as he was overwhelmingly \\nreelected to the Senate four times; to \\nwatch him climb the Senate leadership \\nladder to the position he now holds; \\nand, to see him nominated for the Vice \\nPresidency of the United States in 1976. \\nI have no doubt that the unbeatable \\ncombination of Senator DOLE’S drive \\nand experience, along with what just \\nmight be a strong streak of destiny, \\nmay lead him to the White House be-\\nfore his career in public service comes \\nto an end. \\n\\nSenator DOLE has been leader of the \\nSenate Republicans when we have been \\nboth the majority and minority party \\nin this body and he has distinguished \\nhimself well in both roles. While not \\neveryone may agree with Senator \\nDOLE’S politics, they do respect the \\nmanner in which he conducts himself \\nand the business of the Senate. Now \\nthat our party has once again regained \\ncontrol of this body, I know that Sen-\\nator DOLE will work closely with Mem-\\nbers on the other side of the aisle to \\nensure that they are treated fairly, and \\nthat the 104th Congress will be marked \\nas a period of progress, accomplish-\\nment, and bipartisanship. BOB DOLE is \\na man I hold in high esteem and whose \\nfind friendship I value greatly. \\n\\nAs anyone of us who stood on this \\nside of the aisle for the last 8 years can \\ntell you, being in the minority can be \\na frustrating experience. With an effec-\\ntive leader, though, the minority party \\ncan play an important role in the legis-\\nlative process, not only contributing to \\nthe debate, but strengthening bills \\npassed by Congress. The man whom the \\nDemocrats have elected as their leader, \\nSenator TOM DASCHLE of South Da-\\nkota, is a person who I believe will be \\nan effective voice for Senate Demo-\\ncrats. TOM is no stranger to public \\nservice, as he spent time as an intel-\\nligence officer in the U.S. Air Force, as \\na valued aide to a South Dakota State \\nsenator, and four terms in the U.S. \\nHouse of Representatives, where he \\nheld several leadership positions. Al-\\nthough TOM was just recently elected \\nto the position of Democratic leader, \\nhe has been a distinguished member of \\nthis body for the past 9 years. During \\nhis tenure, Senator DASCHLE has dem-\\nonstrated himself to be an able and ef-\\nfective legislator, working hard for his \\nconstituency in South Dakota. I have \\nhad the pleasure of serving with TOM \\non the Veterans’ Affairs Committee \\nand have found him to be a serious \\nminded man and one of purpose. It was \\nof little surprise to me that TOM rose \\nto the important post he now holds. I \\nhave every confidence that he will be \\nan effective leader for our Democratic \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S575 January 6, 1995 \\ncolleagues and I am equally confident \\nthat he will work well with the Repub-\\nlican majority. \\n\\nWhile many may believe that politics \\nin the United States is based on an ad-\\nversarial relationship between parties, \\neach of us knows that it is a system \\nwhich encourages and fosters com-\\npromise—that to actually legislate, we \\nmust seek common ground. Senators \\nDOLE and DASCHLE are two men who \\nare committed to ensuring that this \\nbody functions efficiently and effec-\\ntively by seeking that point where \\nMembers can vote to pass a bill. I con-\\ngratulate BOB and TOM on winning \\ntheir leadership elections, and I look \\nforward to working with both of them \\nthroughout the duration of the 104th \\nCongress. \\n\\nf \\n\\nWAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? \\nTHE VOTERS SAID YES \\n\\nMr. HELMS. Mr. President, anyone \\neven remotely familiar with the U.S. \\nConstitution knows that no President \\ncan spend a dime of Federal tax money \\nthat has not first been authorized and \\nappropriated by Congress—both the \\nHouse of Representatives and the U.S. \\nSenate. \\n\\nSo when you hear a politician or an \\neditor or a commentator declare that \\n‘‘Reagan ran up the Federal debt’’ or \\nthat ‘‘Bush ran it up,’’ bear in mind \\nthat it was, and is, the constitutional \\nduty and responsibility of Congress to \\ncontrol Federal spending. Congress has \\nfailed miserably in that task for about \\n50 years. \\n\\nThe fiscal irresponsibility of Con-\\ngress has created a Federal debt which \\nstood at $4,805,835,231,225.14 as of the \\nclose of business Thursday, January 5. \\nAveraged out, every man, woman, and \\nchild in America owes a share of this \\nmassive debt, and that per capita share \\nis $18,243.03. \\n\\nf \\n\\nIN MEMORY OF SHERRY STETSON \\nMANNIX \\n\\nMr. WARNER. Mr President, on \\nTuesday of this week, Sherry Stetson \\nMannix died after a long and valiant \\nbattle with cancer. Mrs. Mannix’s title \\nwas Foreign Affairs Specialist in the \\nBureau of Multilateral Affairs of the \\nU.S. Arms Control and Disarmament \\nAgency. But that does not begin to de-\\nscribe her fine work or her life-long \\ndedication to her country. \\n\\nMrs. Mannix served for 11 years as an \\nofficer in the U.S Air Force and then \\nfor another 9 years in the Air Force Re-\\nserve, achieving the rank of lieutenant \\ncolonel. She joined the Arms Control \\nand Disarmament Agency in 1984 and \\nbecame the Agency’s premier expert on \\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, \\nwhich she helped to negotiate. Both be-\\nfore and after the CWC was negotiated, \\nMrs. Mannix was the principal persons \\nto whom we and others turned when \\nquestions arose on how that very com-\\nplicated convention would work. \\n\\nDuring its consideration of the CWC \\nlast year, the Select Committee on In-\\n\\ntelligence, of which I was then vice \\nchairman, submitted to the executive \\nbranch over 130 questions for the \\nrecord regarding the Chemical Weap-\\nons Convention. It was Sherry Mannix \\nwho answered many of those questions \\nand edited the others, even though she \\nwas already in tremendous physical \\npain due to the illness that she knew \\nwould soon take her life. Those an-\\nswers were so well-written and inform-\\native that we actually published 64 of \\nthem, as an appendix to our commit-\\ntee’s public report, ‘‘U.S. Capability to \\nMonitor Compliance With the Chem-\\nical Weapons Convention.’’ Only rarely \\ndo we find such executive branch an-\\nswers so worthy of publishing, and only \\nvery rarely does any human being dem-\\nonstrate the devotion to duty and \\ncountry that Mrs. Mannix did through-\\nout the last year. \\n\\nSherry Mannix was only 44 when she \\ndied. If life were fair, we would have \\nenjoyed her company and her service \\nfor many more years. Instead, we today \\noffer our deep condolence to her hus-\\nband, retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charles \\nR. Mannix, and to her mother, Albertie \\nStetson, both of whom reside in my \\nState, as well as to her grandmother, \\nBernal B. Allen. And in remembering \\nSherry Mannix we say, Thank you for a \\njob well done and a life well lived, right \\nto the very end. \\n\\nf \\n\\nCOMMENDING CHIEF ROBERT \\nSTEWART \\n\\nMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, \\nSouth Carolina is probably the most \\nidyllic place anyone might consider \\nliving. The pace of life there is relaxed, \\nthe people are friendly, and the weath-\\ner is temperate. Unfortunately, even a \\nState as peaceful as mine is not free \\nfrom the evils and dangers of crime. \\n\\nLeading the fight against illegal ac-\\ntivity in the Palmetto State is an orga-\\nnization created by me when I served \\nas Governor of South Carolina, the \\nState Law Enforcement Division, com-\\nmonly referred to as ‘‘SLED.’’ At the \\nhelm of SLED is a man whom I have \\nhad the pleasure of knowing for many \\nyears, Chief Robert M. Stewart, and \\nwhom I am pleased to call a friend. The \\nchief has literally dedicated his life to \\npolice work and has gained national \\nrecognition as an aggressive officer and \\na true professional. \\n\\nChief Stewart, a native of Cheraw, \\nbegan his career as a teenager when he \\nsigned on as a cadet with his hometown \\npolice department and worked his way \\nup the leadership ladder, earning the \\nposition of director of public safety be-\\nfore he had even turned 30. In 1975, he \\nstepped down as director and joined \\nSLED as a special agent. In the fol-\\nlowing 20 years, his career advanced \\nrapidly while he worked on cases rang-\\ning from those that were routine and \\nmundane to ones that were inter-\\nnational in scope. A veteran of the \\nSWAT team, Robert specialized in \\nwhite collar and public corruption \\ncases, and worked closely with Federal \\n\\nagencies investigating such crimes in \\nSouth Carolina. In 1988, Gov. Carroll \\nCampbell appointed Robert as the chief \\nof SLED, where he has done an unpar-\\nalleled job of administering the agen-\\ncy. \\n\\nWhen he took over SLED, Chief \\nStewart’s goal was to make it an orga-\\nnization that was recognized as being \\none of the most professional, progres-\\nsive, and modern law enforcement \\nagencies in the United States. Over the \\npast 7 years he has done just that. By \\nregionalizing the agency, and stream-\\nlining its rank structure, Chief Stewart \\nhas ensured that his agents are better \\nable to monitor and address crime \\ntrends throughout the State. Addition-\\nally, Chief Stewart secured a brand- \\nnew lab, that is not only used by \\nSLED, but is available to any other po-\\nlice department in the State of South \\nCarolina. Thanks to the chief’s com-\\nmitment and vision, last year SLED \\nbecame only the second State inves-\\ntigative agency in the Nation to re-\\nceive professional accreditation by the \\nCommittee on Accreditation of Law \\nEnforcement Agencies. \\n\\nMr. President, Chief Stewart cele-\\nbrates his 50th birthday today, and I \\nwant to take this opportunity to recog-\\nnize and commend him for dedicating \\nmore than half his life to protecting \\nthe people and property of South Caro-\\nlina. Chief Stewart is a man of great \\nability, integrity, and courage, and I \\nam proud of his many accomplish-\\nments. I wish him good health and hap-\\npiness in the years ahead, and look for-\\nward to continuing to hear great \\nthings about him. \\n\\nf \\n\\nUNITED STATES ARMS EMBARGO \\nON BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA \\n\\nMr. DOLE. Mr. President, 2 days ago \\nI introduced legislation together with \\nthe distinguished Senator from Con-\\nnecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, to termi-\\nnate the United States arms embargo \\non Bosnia-Herzegovina as of May 1, \\n1995. \\n\\nAs I mentioned in my remarks at the \\nthat time, I believed that this legisla-\\ntion was not only consistent with \\ninternational law in upholding Bosnia’s \\ninherent right to self-defense, but that \\nit would also serve to provide some \\nbadly needed leverage for the Bosnians \\non the diplomatic side. \\n\\nI understand that today, Adm. Leigh-\\nton Smith, commander of NATO Forces \\nin Southern Europe told reporters that \\nhe opposed this legislation. I am not \\nsurprised that a four-star admiral \\nwould not oppose his Commander in \\nChief, nor that a NATO commander \\nwould not choose to contradict the \\nNATO-Secretary General. \\n\\nI would note, however, that in addi-\\ntion to candidate Bill Clinton, the fol-\\nlowing former high-level Government \\nofficials, including Cabinet members, \\nhave publicly supported lifting the \\narms embargo on Bosnia: Zbigniew \\nBrzezinski; Frank Carlucci; George \\n\\nVerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m\\nm\\n\\nah\\ner\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nM\\nIK\\n\\nE\\nT\\n\\nE\\nM\\n\\nP\\n w\\n\\nith\\n S\\n\\nO\\nC\\n\\nIA\\nL \\n\\nS\\nE\\n\\nC\\nU\\n\\nR\\nIT\\n\\nY\\n N\\n\\nU\\nM\\n\\nB\\nE\\n\\nR\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES576 January 6, 1995 \\nShultz; Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul \\nWolfowitz; Richard Perle; and Max \\nKampelman—quite an impressive list. \\nMoreover, I would emphasize that the \\nlate Manfred Woerner, the previous \\nSecretary General, advocated helping \\nthe victims of aggression, especially \\nwhen the international community \\ndoes not have the resolve to take ac-\\ntion on behalf of that victim. That is \\nsurely the case in Bosnia. \\n\\nIt seems to me however, that the \\nviews that should be given the most \\nweight, are those of the Bosnians. It is \\ntheir country and their future we are \\ntalking about. \\n\\nAnd so, I would like to share two let-\\nters with my colleagues which I re-\\nceived from the President of Bosnia, \\nAlija Izetbegovic, and from the Bosnian \\nAmbassador to the United Nations, \\nMuhamed Sacirbey. Both letters \\nstrongly support the Dole/Lieberman \\nbill. First I would like to quote from \\nPresident Izetbegovic’s letter to me: \\n\\nThe leadership of the United States of \\nAmerica is essential in the search for peace \\nin the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \\nThe legislation that you and Senator \\nLieberman have offered is entirely sup-\\nportive of peace efforts and the continuing \\nleadership of your country in this matter. \\n\\nWe wholeheartedly concur that the arms \\nembargo should be terminated ‘‘de facto’’ no \\nlater than May 1, 1995. By such date the pre-\\nliminary agreement on the cessation of hos-\\ntilities would have expired and by then the \\nSerbians would have opted to accept the con-\\ntract group peace plan or to continue the \\nwar. We believe that this legislation would \\nbe most pivotal not only in confronting \\ninternational aggression and acts of genocide \\nagainst our Republic, but also in encour-\\naging the Serbians to opt for peace. \\n\\nThe letter from Ambassador Sacirbey \\nstates the following, and I quote, \\n\\nWe wish to reiterate our full support for \\ncongressional efforts, in particular S. 21, to \\nterminate the application of the U.S. arms \\nembargo on the Government of the Republic \\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina * * * The ele-\\nments of your proposed legislation are in \\ncomplete convergence with our views. We are \\nalso of the opinion that this legislation is en-\\ntirely consistent with the search for peace in \\nour country * * * \\n\\nWe need to keep things in perspec-\\ntive. The strains within NATO have not \\nbeen caused by congressional efforts to \\nlift the embargo, but the present policy \\nitself. The credibility of the alliance \\nhas been damaged because NATO has \\nallowed itself to become a subcon-\\ntractor to the United Nations. The \\nonly way to reverse this situation is \\nfor the United States to reassert its \\nleadership in support of a better policy. \\nThe Clinton administration was on the \\nright track in May 1993, it is now time \\nto get back on that track. \\n\\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\\nsent that the letters I referred to be \\nprinted in the RECORD. \\n\\nThere being no objection, the letters \\nwere ordered to be printed in the \\nRECORD, as follows: \\n\\nREPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND \\nHERZEGOVINA, PERMANENT MIS-\\nSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS, \\n\\nNew York, January 4, 1995. \\nHon. ROBERT DOLE, \\nMajority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. \\n\\nDEAR MAJORITY LEADER: We wish to reit-\\nerate our full support for Congressional ef-\\nforts, in particular S. 21, to terminate the \\napplication of the U.S. arms embargo on the \\nGovernment of the Republic of Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina. We must also express our sin-\\ncere appreciation for these efforts and our \\nadmiration for the thoughtful manner by \\nwhich this matter has been guided by you. \\nThe elements of your proposed legislation \\nare in complete convergence with our views. \\n\\nWe also are of the opinion that this legisla-\\ntion is entirely consistent with the search \\nfor peace in our country and the congres-\\nsional intent established during the debate \\non this issue during the previous Congres-\\nsional session. The United States delegation \\nto the United Nations, under the capable and \\nfaithful direction of Ambassador Madeleine \\nK. Albright, had ‘‘tabled’’ a draft resolution \\nwithin the Security Council to lift the arms \\nembargo on our Government. Unfortunately, \\nthis resolution met resistance from some \\nkey nations in the Council, although it has \\nnever been put to a vote. In fact, our efforts \\nto facilitate a consensus on this matter \\nthrough flexibility were misconstrued and \\nhave not met with a positive response. \\n\\nWe believe that U.S. leadership in bringing \\nan end to this unjust arms embargo con-\\ntinues to be an essential element in ending \\nthis international aggression and acts of \\ngenocide against my country. \\n\\nOnce again, thank you for your leadership \\nregarding this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, \\nMUHAMED SACIRBEY, \\n\\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative. \\n\\nREPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND \\nHERZEGOVINA, OFFICE OF THE \\nPRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENCY, \\n\\nJanuary 5, 1995. \\nHon.

PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Richard C. Halverson, D.D., offered the following prayer: Let us pray: Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.—Deuteronomy 6:4– 7. God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God of our fathers, we pray this morning for our families. Be especially with those who are traumatized by the process of moving to Washington—finding a residence and settling in a new neighborhood—as the typical Senate schedule begins to build. Help your servants to take seriously the fact that the foundation of the social order is the family. As the family disintegrates, society collapses. Grant to every spouse and every child a special dispensation of grace as the process of legislation demands more and more time from Senators and staffs. Gracious Father in Heaven, bless our families. Help us to be faithful to them in giving our love, attention, and care. Help us to be faithful to ourselves, allowing time to receive the love, patience, and support from our families which we need and depend upon so much. Eternal God, as I close this prayer, thank you for the great privilege of serving the Senate through seven Congresses. In the name of the King of kings, and the Lord of lords. Amen. f RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the acting majority leader is recognized. f ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 9:30 be equally divided between the two leaders, and that at 9:30 we resume consideration of S. 2, the congressional coverage bill. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. f THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995 The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour of 9:30 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. 2, which the clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2) to make certain laws applicable to the legislative branch of the Federal Government. The Senate resumed consideration of the bill. Pending: Ford-Feingold amendment No. 4, to pro hibit the personal use of accrued frequent flyer miles by Members and employees of the Congress. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment of Mr. FORD, No. 4, is pending. Mr. FORD addressed the Chair. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky. Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment I have before the Senate merely prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars for personal use; that is, the frequent flyer mileage miles that are built up as a result of expense-paid trips back to our States. That is simply what it is. I understand that my friends on the other side of the aisle are not ready to accept it, and particularly not ready for a vote. ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside, and I further ask unanimous consent that Senator WELLSTONE be recognized for the introduction of an amendment. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair. Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is recognized. Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. Mr. President, yesterday, in introducing an amendment with Senator LEVIN of Michigan, Senator FEINGOLD, and Senator LAUTENBERG which dealt with lobby disclosure but mainly with gift bans, I on the floor of the Senate read from what I think is a very, very interesting, very important, and very revealing piece in Roll Call of October 17, 1994. The title is, ‘‘How Lobbyists Put Meals, Gifts to Work.’’ VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES530 January 6, 1995 This memo, obtained by Roll Call, says one prominent D.C. firm lays out 1994 strategy, including meals, campaign contributions * * *. And we talked yesterday about trips. Mr. President, the amendment that I am going to introduce today focuses on lobbying. Yesterday, what I urged my colleagues—since so many of us ran on a reform agenda and since so many of us have talked about the need to make this process more accountable, open, and honest—I asked my colleagues really, under the leadership of Senator LEVIN, to vote on an amendment which would say that we would put an end to this taking of gifts. The vote was ‘‘no.’’ So today, focusing on the same question, I am going to, in this amendment, essentially say to my colleagues if you are going to vote ‘‘no’’ against the taking of gifts, the gift ban part, at least let us put a stop to this, I think, insidious connection between the lobbying and the taking of cash and campaign contributions. So this amendment is going to prohibit lobbyists who may lobby within the preceding year from making contributions to or soliciting contributions for Members of Congress and from lobbying Members of Congress to whom they have contributed or on whose behalf they have solicited funds within the previous year. In other words, if you have made a contribution or you have instructed a PAC you control to make a contribution to a candidate, then for 1 year thereafter you should not be lobbying that candidate or staff. Vice versa, if you have been in that office lobbying a Senator or lobbying staff, then there is a 1-year window here whereby you would not be allowed to make a campaign contribution. This amendment is all about congressional accountability. Let me repeat that. This amendment is all about congressional accountability. And it is designed to sever the connection between lobbyists and big PAC contributions to Members of Congress. This covers congressional staff, and it would prohibit lobbyists from lobbying new Members of Congress to whom they have contributed or on whose behalf they have solicited funds during the past year which I think, from the point of view of the new class, also represents real reform. Mr. President, this amendment was part of S. 3, which the Senate passed by a very lopsided vote. Senators then said that they thought this was an important reform idea, or I should say an important reform measure. It would prohibit the practice whereby a lobbyist who lobbies a Member for a client then directs that client to make a contribution to the Member. It closes the potential loophole allowing lobbyists to get around the prohibition by having clients make contributions to Members to further their lobbying efforts. In other words, it is not just a question of lobbyists not being able to do it, but it is also a question of a lobbyist not being able to instruct a client to make such a contribution. This amendment will also prohibit a lobbyist from directing that a contribution be made by a political action committee to a Member of Congress whom that lobbyist has lobbied during the past year, a key element of any reform effort designed to sever—let me emphasize that—the connection, big money connection, between large lobbying firms, their clients, and PAC’s. Mr. President, one more time, we have before us the Congressional Accountability Act. We are talking about how to make this process more accountable. Reform is in the air in America. We started out this session on the basis of a focus on reform, and this particular amendment speaks to that question. Yesterday, I urged my colleagues to vote for an amendment that I thought was a huge step forward—not a small step forward, but a huge step forward— in changing the political culture of Washington in putting a stop to taking these gifts. Many Senators, though I am proud to say by no means all Senators, but certainly many Senators, and on the other side of the aisle, all Senators on the other side of the aisle—I guess there were two exceptions—voted ‘‘no.’’ With this amendment, I am saying if you are not willing to put an end to the accepting of gifts, at least put an end to this insidious connection between lobbying and the giving of money. If there is one thing we have heard from people in the country, it is that they do not like this mix of money and politics. They do not like the fact that some people march on Washington every day. They do not like the fact that this is such a closed loop in which they do not feel as if they participate. And I cannot think of an amendment that would speak more clearly and more directly to people’s concerns than this amendment. Mr. President, this provision, when this amendment was first brought up for S. 3—which again I remind my colleagues was passed by an overwhelmingly positive vote—was crafted narrowly to withstand the test of constitutionality. The Court has said that any seeming infringement on first amendment speech rights has to be balanced against concerns about corruption or the appearance of corruption. That is what we are talking about here, the appearance of corruption. If you run for office and you are elected, lobbyists come in and lobby you, and then later there is a contribution. Or, vice versa, you receive a contribution and lobbyists instruct a PAC or client to make a contribution to you, and then shortly thereafter the lobbyist is in your office. If you want to talk about the appearance of corruption and if you want to talk about a way of making this process more accountable and you want to talk about a way that Senators can live up to our mandate to be reformers, this amendment speaks directly to this question. Mr. President, again, this amendment meets that test. It is directed narrowly at the question of the appearance of corruption or impropriety. Let me emphasis that again. It is directed narrowly at the question of the appearance of corruption or impropriety. And it covers only those situations where a lobbyist has made a lobbying contact and then contributes, solicits on behalf of, or directs that a contribution be made to a Member. It attempts to define who is a lobbyist. By the way, so no mistake will be made, we simply go by the current definition. We get into none of the debate and argument on the reform of lobby disclosure. We just go with the current definition which—and by the way, I think all of us agree, if our words are to be believed—eventually has to be changed. There are many who lobby who are not officially registered as lobbyists today. Mr. President, I also want to include in the RECORD a letter from the White House, January 5, 1995, which was addressed to the Speaker, in which the focus is on congressional reform, with a strong focus on this whole question of lobbying reform. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, January 5, 1995. Hon. NEWT GINGRICH, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Wash ington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER: We have an oppor tunity to make historic change in the way that Washington works and the government does the people’s business. This week, the Congress has begun to take important and positive steps to change its operations for the better. Shrinking the number of committees, reducing staff, and other measures are valuable, and long overdue. The passage of legislation that would apply to Congress the laws that apply to the public is only fair, is simple common sense, and is also long overdue. I hope that this time, unlike the last session of Congress, the Senate follows the House’s action. I congratulate you on these steps. But true congressional reform must reduce the power of lobbyists and special interests. The power of organized money in Washington hurts the middle class, bloats spending and the deficit, and blocks needed change. Today, some 90,000 people in Washington are associated with lobbying Congress on behalf of specific interests, which too often are able to manipulate the congressional process to insert spending projects or tax provisions in legislation that do not serve the larger public’s interest. Lobby power coupled with the ever-escalating cost of campaigns, which has risen fourfold over the past two decades, gives wealthy interests and wealthy candidates disproportionate influence in decisionmaking. These are not partisan concerns; they are American concerns. I urge you, as you undertake the task of reforming Congress, to take on these real political reform issues. VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S531 January 6, 1995 First, as you enact legislation to apply general laws to Congress, it is vital that professional lobbyists be barred from giving gifts, meals and entertainment to members of Congress—just as they are now barred from giving these benefits to executive branch officials. Second, Congress should also quickly enact legislation to bring professional lobbyists into the sunlight of public scrutiny. The current lobby disclosure statute is cumbersome and antiquated. Lobbyists should disclose who their clients are, what bills they seek to pass or block, and how much they are paid. Third, I am pleased that the Congress wants to pass a line item veto authority for the President, something that I have consistently supported before and during the 1992 campaign and since. The line item veto authority will help us cut unnecessary spending and reduce the budget deficit. It is a powerful tool for fighting special interests, who too often are able to win approval of wasteful projects through manipulation of the congressional process, and bury them in massive bills where they are protected from Presidential vetoes. It will increase the accountability of government. I want a strong version of the line item veto, one that enables the President to take direct steps to curb wasteful spending. This is clearly an area where both parties can come together in the national interest, and I look forward to working with the Congress to quickly enact this measure. Finally, we must clean up political campaigns, limit the cost of campaigning, reduce the role of special interests, and increase the role of ordinary citizens. Real campaign finance reform, too, should be an area of bipartisan cooperation. Requiring broadcasters to provide time to bona fide candidates would cut the cost of campaigning and ensure that voters hear all arguments, regardless of candidate wealth. Strong proposals for free TV time have been introduced in previous years by Senator Dole and by the new chair of the House Commerce Committee, Rep. Thomas Bliley; these proposals should be the basis of agreement on reform. I look forward to working with the Congress to achieve results that are bipartisan, bold, and give the government back to the people. Sincerely, BILL CLINTON. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just summarize for my colleagues, because I think that we will be casting an important vote on this amendment, I think it is an important vote because this is sort of a litmus test as to how committed we are to reform. I cite this as a relevant document: Roll Call, Monday, October 17, where the whole focus is on meals and travel and campaign contributions, as ways of having access for clients. Mr. President, if you want to talk about a memo that tells it all, if you want to talk about a memo that, unfortunately, sort of speaks to the very concerns that people have about this process, this is an example. I ask unanimous consent that this Roll Call piece be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From Roll Call, Oct. 17, 1994] HOW LOBBYISTS PUT MEALS, GIFTS TO WORK (By Timothy J. Burger) During the protracted debate over new lobbying and gift rules—which went down to stunning defeat in the waning days of the second session—Members argued violently over the influence of lobbyist-paid meals and campaign contributions. ‘‘Now, a Big Mac will not buy influence from anybody. I am sure $15,000 will not buy influence from anybody,’’ Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind) said on the floor. Mocked retiring House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill): ‘‘Here we are today demeaning ourselves by saying. ‘Oh, please stop me before I accept another cup of coffee and a Danish.’’’ Despite such protestations, meals and contributions are fixtures in the lobbying world—and internal documents from a prominent Washington lobbying firm demonstrate just how central they are to conducting business. In December 1993, principals of Gold and Liebengood assembled plans for expanding their network of Hill contacts for 1994. The planning documents, copies of which were obtained by Roll Call, offer a rare glimpse into the world of lobbying and, specifically, how meals, gifts, and contributions are put to use. Take, for instance, the strategy for James Capel and Co. Ltd., a British securities firm, that is a longtime client of Gold and Liebengood. According to the memo: ‘‘Capel is desirous of dinners, lunches, and meetings for themselves and their clients, with a diverse list of Members of Congress Capel has agreed to pay G&L a separate fee for each and every one of these Congressional visits we arrange. Potential targets: John Dingell, Jack Brooks, Norman Mineta, and Al Swift, were the initial Members mentioned. Capel would be receptive to suggestions from us.’’ The 12-page memo was drafted by Charles Merin, a Gold and Liebengood partner, and John Scruggs, the firm’s managing director and a former aide to then-Rep. Trent Lott (R-Miss). It includes specific agencies for each of the principals. Among Scruggs’s ‘‘targets’’ were Reps. Porter Goss (R-Fla) and Pat Danner (D-Mo). ‘‘Congresswoman Danner defeated Tom Coleman. Coleman was a strong and consistent supporter of Wilcox. Need to develop similar relationship with Danner,’’ the memo noted. ‘‘Action: Continue to work with staff (hesitancy to accept gifts). Ask Chuck Merin for introduction followed by fundraising activity.’’ Wilcox, a manufacturing company, is a former Gold and Leibengood client. Regarding Goss, the outline noted: ‘‘Porter Goss became a member of the Rules Committee early in this Congress. Only Minority Member on the committee with whom I do not have an established relationship. ‘‘Action: Seek opportunity for campaign contribution, followed by goodwill development.’’ It appears, however, that Gold and Liebengood did not follow through on all of its plans. Goss and Danner told Roll Call they never heard from Scruggs. Among the ‘‘targets’’ outlined for Merin were Alan Roth, staff director of the House Energy and Commerce Committee—‘‘Multiple client interests before the Committee would be enhanced by a better working relationship with him’’—and Democratic Reps. Bobby Rush (Ill), Scotty Baesler (Ky), and Bobby Scott (Va). The Merin outline describes the Congressmen as ‘‘Promising Freshman Members with whom I need to firm up an existing, but casual relationship. ‘‘Action: Arrange sit-downs/meals with these Members and mutual Member friends. ‘‘Ask Jack Clough, former E&C Committee top aide, to arrange a lunch.’’ Merin said he never followed through with Roth, Baesler, or Scott and that he become acquainted with Rush through meetings, not meals, with the Congressman. Scruggs, Merin, and a founding partner, former Senate Sergeant at Arms Howard Liebengood, last week were shown copies of the documents obtained by Roll Call. In a letter of response, Scruggs wrote: ‘‘The documents are not newsworthy in any respect and were intended solely for private not public consumption. The activities suggested in the documents are neither unique nor inappropriate in any manner. As this firm is bipartisan and has no Political Action Committee, all members are encouraged to participate in political development-individually and they do.’’ Gold and Liebengood is in the final year of a five-year buyout and will be wholly owned by Burson-Marsteller at the end of 1994. The memo also documents the firm’s involvement in leadership races. Written some 11 months ago, the Gold and Liebengood ‘‘Campaign Activity Outline’’ discussed Merin’s plans to work on the year’s most dramatic long-shot leadership race: ‘‘Charlie Rose for Speaker.’’ Merin’s plans were to ‘‘Continue working with Rose and his campaign deputies to broaden the network of Member commitments.’’ This type of activity is ‘‘always a game of Russian roulette,’’ said Howard Marlowe of the lobbying firm, Marlowe & Co., who served as president of the American League of Lobbyists from 1988 to 1990 and is a member of the organization’s board. ‘‘As long as you back the winner, then you’ve made the right choice,’’ said Marlowe. ‘‘[And] in this case, the loser is somebody who’s still around and so whatever you did to help him or her out is probably going to be remembered. So I think that probably represents a smart political move on their part.’’ But, Marlowe said, ‘‘I think in general lobbyist ought to probably try to refrain from getting involved in the internal leadership of the House or Senate.’’ Said Merin of his involvement in the leadership race: ‘‘The election of a Speaker of the House, much like the appointment of any Member to any committee, is a matter exclusively and totally within the purview of the institution. The ability of any outsider to leverage the process to his or her advantage is virtually nil. The only real role any outside can play in the process is to provide limited advice and counsel.’’ Said Rose: ‘‘I don’t see Chuck Merin much more than I see other lobbyists that visit me.

The vote for leadership around here comes from the Democratic Caucus. And Chuck has helped me raise money for Democratic candidates.’’ Also on Merin’s agenda is ‘‘Vic Fazio for Caucus Chair.’’ The plan called for Merin to ‘‘Assist Fazio [D-Calif] with Member contacts on an as directed basis, relative to hid bid to succeed Steny Hoyer.’’ Fazio, the Democratic Caucus VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES532 January 6, 1995 vice chairman, is unopposed in a bid to succeed Hoyer. Asked about the memo, a Fazio aide said: ‘‘Mr. Merin has been a good friend and supportive of Mr. Fazio’s campaigns in the past.’’ The most prominent political activity listed for Scruggs, meanwhile, is the ‘‘Bob Walker for Whip’’ campaign. Walker (Pa) is running against Reps. Tom DeLay (Texas) and Bill McCollum (Fla) for the GOP Whip post that Rep. Newt Gingrich (Ga) will leave when he’s elected Republican Leader in December. Scruggs, the memo states, is ‘‘Serving on advisory group of lobbyists supporting Walker Whip campaign.’’ It cites a ‘‘Commitment to do ‘meet and greets’ for GOP candidates identified by Walker as he campaigns for potential GOP freshmen in next year’s Congressional races.’’ Said Walker in an interview, ‘‘This is a guy who is a personal friend of mine of 20 years standing. * * * It’s not being done as a lobbyist. It’s being done as a personal friend.’’ Walker said Scruggs ‘‘consults with me from time to time * * * and has put together some meet and greets.’’ Walker said Scruggs is only one of many lobbyists working on his behalf. Gold and Liebengood does not have a PAC and does not as a firm formally back specific candidates, although its 13 individual lobbyists are encouraged to follow their own political development agendas. This sometimes leads Gold and Liebengood lobbyists to support opposing candidates for the same office. Underscoring this point, Scruggs said in the interview that ‘‘Gold and Liebengood is not working for Charlie Rose for Speaker. Because I’m the managing director and I’m supporting Newt Gingrich for Speaker and I think that sort of sums it up.’’ Said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics: ‘‘We always expect this happens. But you know that level of involvement in leadership races is pretty startling. It’s another chapter in the book ‘How Washington Really Works’. * * * I’m afraid it’s not unique at all.’’ ‘‘Do I know we get targeted? Sure,’’ said Goss. As a public official, ‘‘You give up some privacy and you just expect people are trying to figure out ways to get access to get their views across.’’ Other political development projects listed for Merin: ‘‘Mel Watts [sic] for a Rules Committee seat. The Congressional Black Caucus will be able to recommend a successor to [A]lan Wheat on the Rules Committee. Mel is the CBC Chairman’s choice for that vacancy. Assist Mel in building a network of non-CBC Steering and Policy Committee Members who will support his appointment.’’ Watt said this month he has no knowledge of the memo or Merin’s interest in winning him a spot on the Rules panel. ‘‘Al Wynn for an Energy and Commerce Committee Seat. Maryland is looking to get back the seat it lost with Tom McMillen’s defeat. Anticipated Member defeats/departures will create Democratic vacancies at the Committee. Help Albert craft his campaign for an appointment.’’ Merin gave Wynn’s re-election $200, according to FEC records. An aide to Wynn—who had previously expressed interest in Rules, not Energy and Commerce—had no comment. ‘‘Greg Laughlin for a Ways and Means Committee Seat. The departure of Representatives Pickle and Andrews from the Congress will create two vacancies for Texas Democrats to fill. Greg is the leading delegation choice for one of those vacancies. Assist him in securing non-Texas Steering and Policy Committee votes as the year goes on.’’ Laughlin could not be reached for comment. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, to summarize, this amendment is designed to prohibit lobbyists from making contributions to, or soliciting contributions for Members of Congress whom they have lobbied within the preceding year, and from lobbying Members of Congress to whom they have contributed or on whose behalf they have solicited funds within the previous year. If you have gone in—this includes staff as well—if you have gone in to see one of the Senators as a lobbyist or gone in to lobby with staff, then for 1 year—that is what we are talking about—you are not allowed to make campaign contributions. If you have contributed to a Senator, then within a 1-year period of time, you are prohibited from lobbying the Senator or staff. This is all about making this process more open. This is all about reform. This is all about making sure we have a system in our country of democracy for the many and not democracy for the few. This is all about congressional accountability. And yesterday, too many of my colleagues—as it did not get a majority vote—voted against ending this practice of receiving the gifts, the argument being we will get to it later. By the way, since I have been here in the Senate, I have heard that argument over and over and over again. I think we will get to it later this term. I know I will bring this up over and over and over again until we do get to it. Today I say this to my colleagues: If you are not going to agree with the proposition that we should put an end to the taking of these gifts now, then at least agree to the proposition—if we are talking about congressional accountability—that we ought not to be taking this money from lobbyists. At least agree there ought to be a 1-year period of time between the lobbying activity and the giving of money. Does it not seem as if this is reasonable? Does it not seem as if this is a prudent course? Does it not seem that if we are talking about reform, we ought to vote for this? We cannot separate the legislative lives we live and how we vote from the words we speak. AMENDMENT NO. 5 (Purpose: To restrict political contributions by lobbyists) Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GREGG). The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. WELLSTONE] proposes an amendment numbered 5. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ll. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS BY LOBBYISTS. Section 315 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ‘‘(i)(1) A lobbyist, or a political committee controlled by a lobbyist, shall not make contributions to, or solicit contributions for or on behalf of— ‘‘(A) any member of Congress with whom the lobbyist has, during the preceding 12 months, made a lobbying contact; or ‘‘(B) any authorized committee of the President of the United States if, during the preceding 12 months, the lobbyist has made a lobbying contact with a covered executive branch official. ‘‘(2) A lobbyist who, or a lobbyist whose political committee, has made any contribution to, or solicited contributions for or on behalf of, any member of Congress or candidate for Congress (or any authorized committee of the President) shall not, during the 12 months following such contribution or solicitation, make a lobbying contact with such member or candidate who becomes a member of Congress (or a covered executive branch official). ‘‘(3) If a lobbyist advises or otherwise suggests to a client of the lobbyist (including a client that is the lobbyist’s regular employer), or to a political committee that is funded or administered by such a client, that the client or political committee should make a contribution to or solicit a contribution for or on behalf of— ‘‘(A) a member of Congress or candidate for Congress, the making or soliciting of such a contribution is prohibited if the lobbyist has made a lobbying contact with the member of Congress within the preceding 12 months; or ‘‘(B) an authorized committee of the President, the making or soliciting of such a contribution shall be unlawful if the lobbyist has made a lobbying contact with a covered executive branch official within the preceding 12 months. ‘‘(4) For purposes of this subsection— ‘‘(A) the term ‘covered executive branch official’ means the President, Vice-President, any officer or employee of the executive office of the President other than a clerical or secretarial employee, any officer or employee serving in an Executive Level I, II, III, IV, or V position as designated in statute or Executive order, any officer or employee serving in a senior executive service position (as defined in section 3232(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code), any member of the uniformed services whose pay grade is at or in excess of 0-7 under section 201 of title 37, United States Code, and any officer or employee serving in a position of confidential or policy-determining character under schedule C of the excepted service pursuant to regulations implementing section 2103 of title 5, United States Code; ‘‘(B) the term ‘lobbyist’ means a person required to register under section 308 of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act (2 U.S.C. 267) or the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (22 U.S.C. 611 et seq.) or any successor Federal law requiring a person who is a lobbyist or foreign agent to register or a person to report its lobbying activities; and ‘‘(C) the term ‘lobbying contact’— ‘‘(i) means an oral or written communica tion with or appearance before a member of Congress or covered executive branch official made by a lobbyist representing an interest of another person with regard to— VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S533 January 6, 1995 ‘‘(I) the formulation, modification, or adoption of Federal legislation (including a legislative proposal); ‘‘(II) the formulation, modification, or adoption of a Federal rule, regulation, Executive order, or any other program, policy or position of the United States Government; or ‘‘(III) the administration or execution of a Federal program or policy (including the negotiation, award, or administration of a Federal contract, grant, loan, permit, or license); but ‘‘(ii) does not include a communication that is— ‘‘(I) made by a public official acting in an official capacity; ‘‘(II) made by a representative of a media organization who is primarily engaged in gathering and disseminating news and information to the public; ‘‘(III) made in a speech, article, publication, or other material that is widely distributed to the public or through the media; ‘‘(IV) a request for an appointment, a request for the status of a Federal action, or another similar ministerial contact, if there is no attempt to influence a member of Congress or covered executive branch official at the time of the contact; ‘‘(V) made in the course of participation in an advisory committee subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I, in a short period of time, have to get ready for a call-in that I do back with Minnesotans. So not seeing anybody, I am wondering whether colleagues are interested in debating this. If not, I will ask unanimous consent that this amendment, for the moment, be set aside. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. What was the specific point that the Senator from Minnesota requested? Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that if there was no further debate at the moment, that my amendment be temporarily set aside. I have another engagement, but I will be back at 11 and ready to debate. Mr. GRASSLEY. I think some debate may proceed on your amendment while you are gone because people on our side of the aisle want to speak on that. So I would like to keep his amendment before the body. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Iowa that that course is very reasonable, as long as I would have time to respond. I will be back here at 11. Mr. GRASSLEY. Obviously, we will be able to do that since there is no time agreement. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the request withdrawn? Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, just to clarify this, if there is not sufficient opposition on this side to take up the time, if another amendment was brought to the floor before Senator WELLSTONE comes back, I presume it would be OK if we set it aside and went on with the other amendment. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be agreeable to either proposition. If Senators want to debate this—and certainly there should be debate on this amendment, as that is what we are all about, and it is an important debate—I would be pleased to have this amendment out on the floor. I will be back at 11 and I will be pleased to respond. If other Senators come with amendments and there are not Senators speaking directly to this amendment, I would be pleased to have this amendment set aside. Mr. GLENN. I will not object. Mr. WELLSTONE. I do withdraw my initial unanimous-consent request. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the situation this morning, Friday morning, is that we are on S. 2. This is a bill that we Republicans, the new majority, promised that we would give early consideration to, and hopefully pass early on to get the bill to the President for signature. The House of Representatives, in their first day of session, unanimously, on a rollcall vote, passed this piece of legislation. This legislation provides that the exemptions that Congress as an institution and individual Members of Congress have had as employers from certain employment and safety laws, in some instances for over 60 years, will no longer be in place. The purpose of this legislation is to end the environment in this country where we have two sets of laws—one for Capitol Hill and the one for everybody else, everywhere else in the country. It will end a situation where there is one set of laws for Pennsylvania Avenue and another set of laws for Main Street, U.S.A. It will end the situation where employees of Congress do not have the same employment and safety rights and access to the courts for the enforcement of those rights that private sector employees have. For a long period of time people, in the private sector, both employees and employers, but particularly employers, have resented a legal situation in this country where laws passed for the safety and the employment rights of individual private-sector employees of this country, have been in place for one set of employees but not for another. The burden of regulation on the private- sector employer has been in place, but that burden of regulation has not been in place for Capitol Hill. And, of course, that resentment has mounted, and mounted, and mounted over several years now that this has become an issue. It was No. 1 on the list of promises that the new majority made to the American people that we would pass. Consequently, that is why it did pass the House of Representatives and that is consequently why our distinguished majority leader, Senator DOLE, made a promise to make that the first bill for consideration of this body. So we had a full day’s debate on this bill yesterday and we are probably going to have a full day’s debate today and into next week. But I notice from the debate yesterday and the debate so far today, it is not on the substance of the legislation: ending the situation where we have one set of laws for Congress and another set of laws for the rest of the country. I am glad to know that there is that fair amount of unanimity, maybe a great deal of consensus, at least, on the issue of the legislation. But debate yesterday was on the issue of lobbying and on the issue of gifts—very legitimate issues to be discussed before this body—and now this morning we are starting debate on unrelated legislation dealing with lobbying; again, a very legitimate subject for the Senator from Minnesota to bring to this floor. But is it legitimate at this time to bring it before this body? Well, of course, under the rules, it is. But does it fit in with the goals that people desired for this Congress early on when they made the decision in the last election to send a new majority to the House and Senate and to the House for the first time in 40 years? I think not, particularly in light of the fact that the distinguished majority leader, Senator DOLE, has promised that all of these issues will have time for discussion on the floor of this body very early in this session, probably within the next 2, 3, 4 months, at the latest. So I beg the Senator from Minnesota and the Senators from other States VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES534 January 6, 1995 that have other amendments not germane to the specific purpose of S. 2 to wait for the appropriate time so that we do not frustrate the will of the people expressed in the last election, and that we move forward with ending this special treatment of Capitol Hill to be exempted from 11 major pieces of legislation. Let us move on with this bill, get it to the President for signature— the President wants to sign it—and then take up the usual course of business and abide with faith in the promise of the distinguished majority leader that these issues will be brought up and bring them up at that appropriate time. We should not try to wreck a very good piece of legislation that passed the House unanimously and I will bet will almost pass this body unanimously as well. I yield the floor and urge Senators on my side who want to debate Senator WELLSTONE’s amendment to please come over here and do that, because we will not have rollcalls as long as there is a leadership meeting down at the White House. Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Ohio. Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not have a dog in this fight. I do not have an amendment that I am proposing here, but I cannot help but respond to the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Iowa. I will be very brief because I know Senator SIMON would like to make a statement here on the floor and I am happy to see him do that. But this idea that somehow because there is a push on for something here that we can avoid having anyone put on amendments is wishful thinking. I need only go back in my mind’s eye and remember what was happening about 60 days ago or 90 days ago here on floor when anything we put forth was subject to amendments, extraneous or not. It was delay for delay’s sake and it was a scorched earth policy. To say that we should let some piece of legislation, as much as I want it— and I am as big a backer on this piece of legislation on congressional accountability one could possibly be, but it is entirely within the right of any Senator who wants to offer an amendment. Although I do not have an amendment to offer, I do not want to let anything go by that would be critical of people who do have amendments to offer and are offering them in all good sincerity. They think it is right. If they want to attach it on by the rules of the Senate, we, obviously, can do that. We had talk here yesterday about we should be giving the new majority a chance to govern. Well, we do not set aside all the Senate rules in giving anybody a chance to lead or a chance to govern. I am all for leadership having all the leadership prerogatives, but those prerogatives do not mean that we are able to set aside amendments that people may, in all sincerity, propose, whether I agree with them or not. I yield the floor. Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Illinois. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 5 minutes as if in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f THE STRIKE AT BRIDGESTONE/ FIRESTONE Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, on July 12, of last year, 4,200 members of the United Rubber Workers went on strike at Bridgestone/Firestone. The plants are in Decatur, IL; Des Moines, IA; Oklahoma City; Akron, OH; and Noblesville, IN. Negotiations had been going on for some time prior to that on the new contract. The United Rubber Workers had insisted on a similar contract to the contract they had with Goodyear. Bridgestone/Firestone, which is wholly owned by a Japanese company, insisted they could not do that, and then negotiations broke off. The distinguished Senator from Ohio, as well as some of our colleagues, met with the Japanese Ambassador and urged that they renew negotiations. Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated so that Bridgestone/Firestone has said they are going to permanently replace all these workers. It is the first time in modern history that that has been done in a large scale, with the exception of the PATCO strike. And there, frankly, you had people who were breaking the Federal law, and President Reagan—and I think it could have been handled better—but President Reagan made the proper decision that you cannot violate the Federal law and he replaced the workers. This is an unusual situation. It is contrary to the traditions of labor-management relations in our country. Interestingly, it would be illegal in Japan. Now, we have a situation where 2,000 or more workers are going to be permanently replaced. It is not going to be good for labor-management relations in those communities. It is not going to be good for United States-Japanese relations. It is just a bad situation all the way around. My hope is that we can urge our friends in Japan and urge the leaders of this company to recognize this is not wise. Short-term may save a few bucks. I do not know any of the details of the negotiations. But I have been involved in labor-management negotiations often enough that I know if you sit around a table and try and work things out, generally you can work out a practical compromise. I urge they do that. That they not go ahead as they are now planning. I will, later today, be contacting some of our colleagues in the affected States with a resolution that they may want to cosponsor, urging that they get back to the negotiating table and not have this permanent striker replacement. It is interesting that of the modern nations only Great Britain, Singapore, and Hong Kong permit permanent striker placement, plus the United States. But we have a tradition of not doing it. That tradition is occasionally violated by a very small company, but rarely by any company this large. I hope we can have some common sense by the leaders of this industry. I hope the leaders of this industry and the United Rubber Workers can get together. I urge them not to proceed with the permanent replacement of these workers. I yield the floor, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Tennessee. Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995 The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:15 a.m. today the Senate resume consideration of the Wellstone amendment, No. 5, and at that point Senator MCCONNELL will be recognized to speak for not more than 10 minutes, to be followed by 20 minutes under the control of Senator WELLSTONE. I further ask unanimous consent that at 11:45 a.m. the majority leader, or his designee, be recognized to make a motion to table the Wellstone amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that if the Wellstone amendment is not tabled, Senator BROWN be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment. Mr. President, I have also been informed that Senator COATS will be here presently and would like to speak briefly on the WELLSTONE amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I want to ask my good friend from Minnesota if he was or had ever been a member of the American Civil Liberties Union? Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not think that I am now. I make a lot of contributions to a lot of organizations and I cannot tell the gentleman for sure. If I had been a member, I would have been proud to do so. However, I cannot answer for sure because I cannot remember our previous records. Mr. MCCONNELL. I thank my friend from Minnesota. Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to call my wife, Sheila, and we will go over our records and be pleased to announce when we made a contribution, if we did. Mr. MCCONNELL. I am sure my friend from Minnesota agrees with the Senator from Kentucky that the American Civil Liberties Union on many occasions has done fine work. Much of it I find myself in disagreement with. There have been those times, I think, clearly proving the objectivity of the ACLU when I find myself allied with them. The American Civil Liberties Union as earlier testified on the proposal that the Senator from Minnesota has offered, because it was as he indicated, a part of S. 3, an unfortunate measure that the Senate mercifully put to rest last year through some effort. The occupant of the chair participated in this effort, as well as the Senator from Kentucky, regarding the rights of people to participate in the political process. Now, what the Senator from Minnesota has done is craft a measure which I am certain would be quite popular with the people of the United States since they have become convinced that lobbyists are odious folks who are up here buying influence and subverting the political process. Unless, of course, the lobbyists happens to be working for a cause they believe in, in which case they think the lobbyist is doing great work for America. Regardless, this notion that this particular segment of our society should be singled out for unconstitutional treatment, it seems to me, is completely absurd. Maybe what we ought to do is introduce an amendment saying trial lawyers cannot contribute to a campaign, or maybe labor unions cannot contribute to campaign. How about bad lobbyists cannot contribute to campaigns? Surely there are good lobbyists and bad lobbyists. Maybe we would pick out the bad lobbyists and they cannot contribute. Well, Mr. President, you get my drift. The Constitution clearly does not allow us to single out certain kinds of Americans because of their professions and take away their constitutional rights. It is simply impermissible. It might be popular. Somebody told me, and I did not see the survey, somebody told me that in recent years many Americans indi cated they do not support the Bill of Rights. I do not know whether that is true or not. Apparently some pollster asked a series of questions based upon the Bill of Rights and apparently many people did not support those items. It would not surprise me that the amendment as crafted by the Senator from Minnesota would probably make for a terrific campaign commercial but the point is it trashes the Constitution. It absolutely trashes the Constitution. It is not even in the gray area. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to read from the testimony of the American Civil Liberties Union before the Senate Rules Committee, May 19, 1993, on this point, in testifying on the issue of prohibiting contributions from lobbyists. And the testimony said: ‘‘Another clearly unconstitutional provision in the President’s proposal’’—this was in President Clinton’s campaigning finance bill—‘‘is the ban on political contributions by registered lobbyists (or alternatively, the ban on lobbying by political contributors). Lobbying is both the essence of political speech and association and is specifically protected under the first amendment as the right of the people ‘to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.’ The various expressive rights encompassed by that notion are considered indivisible. After all, the first amendment ‘was fashioned to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of legal and social change as desired by the people’. Lobbying is nothing more than a manifestation of this interchange,’’ said the ACLU, ‘‘because lobbying is designed to influence public policy, the speech that is burdened by this proposal is ‘at the heart of the first amendment’s protections’.’’ Quoting the case of First National Bank of Boston versus Bellotti in 1978 and constitutes ‘‘the essence of self-government,’’ and CBS versus FCC, Garrison versus Louisiana. ‘‘Moreover,’’ the testimony said, ‘‘it is wholly at odds with the guarantees of the first amendment to place legislative restrictions on those engaged in ’the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of passage of defeat of legislation’.’’ ‘‘The Court’s decision’’, the ACLU went on, ‘‘make apparent that these activities involve the highest level of constitutional protection.’’ The highest level of constitutional protection, Mr. President. We are not talking about an issue that is in the gray area. This is not a close call, Mr. President. The highest level of constitutional protection. The ACLU went on, Like other provisions in the proposal, the ban on making political contributions is an unconstitutional condition imposed because of the exercise of a constitutional right. It does not matter that it is primarily aimed at those who represented moneyed interests, because the provision will not affect those interests—only their registered lobbying representative. Thus, it is both ineffective in accomplishing that goal and in preventing the ap pearance of corruption. Because the bill already establishes contribution limits in order to cabin the potential for corruption, that potential has been removed from the field of contention. There are no legitimate grounds—— I repeat, Mr. President, no legitimate grounds— to believe that a lobbyist restricted to the same maximum contributions will have any more undue influence over a legislator’s views than anyone else. Thus, the specially restrictive treatment of lobbyists can only be viewed as a penalty for their frequent and sustained exercise of their constitutional right to address public policy issues before the political branches of Government. This is it, Mr. President. And I see my friend from Indiana is here. I am about to wrap it up. The Constitution simply does not tolerate that result. The Constitution does not tolerate that result. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent—— Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for some questions? Mr. MCCONNELL. Just for a second. I would like to ask unanimous con sent, Mr. President, that a letter dated today from the American Civil Liberties Union legislative counsel, Robert S. Peck, on the amendment before us, appear in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, Washington, DC, January 6, 1995. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR MCCONNELL: This morning, Senator Wellstone proposed an amendment to S. 2 that would prohibit political contributions to federal officeholders by registered lobbyists. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the amendment as inconsistent with the guarantees of the First Amendment. The amendment would prohibit lobbyists from making political contributions during a period of one year following a lobbying contact. Alternatively, if a lobbyist does make a political contribution, the lobbyist would be prohibited from making a lobbying that member of Congress or covered executive branch officers for a one-year period following the contact. Finally, it prohibits lobbyists from suggesting to clients possible recipients of their campaign contributions. The First Amendment provides, among other things, broad guarantees of freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. The Supreme Court, in the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), held that campaign contributions are a form of free speech that is protected under the Constitution. The Buckley Court approved of a system of campaign contributions limitations that were designed to avoid the appearance of corruption as the least restrictive means of furthering an important governmental interest without unduly obviating a constitutional right. Because these contribution limits still stand, further restrictions on contribution rights, such as the limitation on contributions by VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES536 January 6, 1995 lobbyists, do not meet the constitutional requirements of the least-restrictive-means test. Moreover, the First Amendment also the right to lobby, denominated in the Constitution as the right ‘‘to petition.’’ As the Court said in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484 (1957), the First Amendment ‘‘was fashioned to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.’’ Lobbying is nothing more than a manifestation of this interchange. Because lobbying is designed to influence public policy, the speech that is burdened by this proposal is ‘‘at the heart of the First Amendment’s protection,’’ First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti, 435 U.S. 765, 776 (1978), and constitutes ‘‘the essence of self-government.’’ CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 US. 367, 396 (1981) (quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 75 (1964)). Moreover, it is ‘‘ ‘wholly at odds with the guarantees of the First Amendment’ ’’ to place legislative restrictions on those engaged in ‘‘ ‘the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of passage or defeat of legislation.’ ’’ Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 428 (1988) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 50, 48 (1976)). The court’s decision make apparent that these activities involve the highest level of constitutional protection. The ban on making political contributions proposed by this amendment is an unconstitutional condition imposed because of the exercise of a constitutional right. It does not matter that it is primarily aimed at those who represent moneyed interests, because the provision will not affect those interests— only their registered lobbying representative. Thus, it is both ineffective in accomplishing that goal and in preventing the appearance of corruption. The existence of contribution limitations already cabins the potential for corruption. Thus, there are no legitimate grounds to believe that a lobbyist restricted to the same maximum contributions will have any more undue influence over a legislator’s views than anyone else. The ACLU urges the Senate to reject this amendment, as unconstitutional and ill-conceived. Sincerely, ROBERT S. PECK, Legislative Counsel. Mr. WELLSTONE. Actually, Mr. President, instead, the Senator from Indiana wants to speak to the same amendment. I wondered whether I could just respond for a moment first to the Senator from Kentucky, if the Senator from Indiana will give me that courtesy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Minnesota objecting to the request of the Senator from Kentucky? Mr. WELLSTONE. No. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe I have floor. I do not want to unduly detain the Senator from Indiana. I want to wrap it up. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, if I may inquire of the Chair of the procedure here, it is my understanding that we will move to procedure under the unanimous-consent agreement. If that is the case, I will not be able to give my statement and I can give it later. Mr. MCCONNELL. If the Senator will yield. Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield to the Senator. Mr. MCCONNELL. I believe the vote will be at a quarter to 12. I will be through in a minute. Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield to the Sen ator from Minnesota. Mr. WELLSTONE. Instead of asking a question, I wonder if I may have some time to respond. Then, of course, the Senator from Kentucky—— Mr. MCCONNELL. Why not have the Senator from Minnesota and myself simply enter into a colloquy and address the Chair? Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota is in the Chamber. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the colloquy is in order. Mr. MCCONNELL. I am pleased to do so. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have enjoyed having colloquies and discussion with the Senator from Kentucky in the past and always respect what he has to say. Let me start out by saying that I just bet there is one thing the Senator from Kentucky and I will agree on, and what we will agree on is that the American Civil Liberties Union is not always right. Does the Senator from Kentucky agree with me on that? Mr. MCCONNELL. I certainly agree with the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. President, that the ACLU is not always right. However, it certainly has been on the campaign finance issues, and I think they have been a lot right on constitutional questions. This is an organization, Mr. President, we all know exists to help Americans enforce first amendment rights. And what the Senator from Minnesota is seeking to do here today is to set aside a type of American citizen and say that because you earn your income in this particular way, you do not have the constitutional rights that everybody else in America has. The ACLU said this is constitutionally impermissible. I hope that will be persuasive to my colleagues, and that is the reason I raised the point. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the reason I make this point is the American Civil Liberties Union is not always right, and I think all of my colleagues understand that. I do not think they are right on this issue. I do not think the American Civil Liberties Union was right on the lobbying disclosure. They take a certain position. I think my colleagues know, including, Mr. President, my colleague from Kentucky, that my record, my passion about the importance of first amendment rights is clear, very clear. But the American Civil Liberties Union is simply wrong again. Mr. President, what the Supreme Court has said in Bellotti is that any significant infringement on first amendment speech rights has to be balanced against concerns about corruption or appearance of corruption. Mr. President, understand what this is all about, this is trying to break this very clear nexus—— Mr. MCCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. WELLSTONE. In just a moment. I would like to finish my analysis, if I may. Mr. MCCONNELL. I thought we were in a colloquy here, and I would like the Senator to respond to a question, if he can. Mr. WELLSTONE. We are in a colloquy, but I think the Senator will be better able to ask me a question if I can just finish my point. Mr. MCCONNELL. All right. Mr. WELLSTONE. So, Mr. President, the point is that we are talking about a very clear nexus here between lobbying and the giving of money. Just so my colleagues understand, this amendment is designed to prohibit lobbyists from making contributions to or soliciting contributions for Members of Congress whom they have lobbied within the preceding year—1 year, that is what we are talking about—and from lobbying Members of Congress to whom they have contributed or on whose behalf they have solicited funds within the previous year. Now, Mr. President, this amendment was part of S. 3, which passed by a fairly significant margin in the Senate. At the very end of the last session, we had a filibuster which prevented the campaign finance reform bill from going to conference committee, as I remember. But many Senators voted for this amendment. It was in the bill. And once again, Mr. President, I am just simply responding to the bill before us. I am trying to improve this bill. It is called congressional accountability. Yesterday, Senators said they would not vote for the proposition that we should not take the gifts. Today, I am saying should we not at least go on record, if we are interested in a more accountable process, that we do not take these contributions within this 1- year period of time? I think this is, of course, open to a challenge, a constitutional challenge, as is much of the legislation that we pass. But with all due respect—I am not a lawyer, Mr. President, but I can just tell you that there are two sides to this question. The fact that the ACLU does not agree with this amendment does not mean, therefore, that this amendment, ipso facto, should be declared unconstitutional by my colleagues. That is simply not the case. I think it will withstand the scrutiny of the courts. In any case, the real issue here is about reform, is about the influence of lobbyists, is about making sure that we make this process more accountable, and it is about breaking this connection between money and lobbying and at least having this 1-year window. That is what this is about. Mr. MCCONNELL addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.

You, by unanimous consent, are engaging in a colloquy, so it is your time. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I am just going to reclaim the floor very briefly, and then I am going to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Indiana. The Senator from Minnesota cites no cases—because there are none—for the proposition that he suggests. I cited four or five. This is not in the gray area. This is clearly unconstitutional. The Senator argues that because of the perception problem, the rights of lobbyists should be taken away. My guess is there may be a perception that labor unions contribute to campaigns, too. Maybe we should take their rights away. Or others may think we ought not to have trial lawyers contribute to political campaigns and maybe we should take their rights away. The Constitution does not make it possible to pick on people by taking rights away in legislation. This is not a close call, Mr. President. This is clearly, blatantly unconstitutional. Mr. President, what time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair indicates the Senator from Kentucky has 6 minutes and 20 seconds remaining. Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield all of my time to the Senator from Indiana. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I do want to state I came to the floor to make a statement on the underlying bill and not on this particular amendment. If it would be more appropriate to make that statement at a different time, I will be happy to do that. The Senator may want to address the specifics of this amendment before he yields the time. Mr. MCCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Indiana, I have said all I want to say about this and I am happy to yield the remainder of my time. Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers fought a revolution against what they saw as an imperial government, a government that taxed them to the point of despair and denied their freedom. From this revolution, they built a country on the idea that the preservation of the freedom and the integrity of the common man was the measure of good government. Last year, on the 8th day of November, the American people rebelled once again, this time not against an imperial government but against an imperial Congress. They fought this revolution with the legacy of our Founding Fathers. They fought it with their vote. The American people voted in November to overthrow an entrenched, distant Congress. They forcefully demonstrated that they were very deeply cynical about their Government and deeply skeptical about its ability to create sound public policy. They de cided that an institution which could not govern itself could not govern the rest of us. It was a sobering decision because it is impossible to be simultaneously held in contempt by the American public and to be viewed as an institution capable of providing leadership on the major problems facing our Nation. And so the simple conclusion and the simple fact is this. We must restore the faith of the American people in their elected representatives if major problems are to be effectively addressed and endorsed and embraced by the American people. We need to create an environment in this body where we can focus on important problems. That is the mandate of the election and that requires major reform in the way that this institution conducts its business. Four years ago I stood before this body to introduce four measures designed to rein in an out-of-touch Congress. These measures ensured that there would be an end to the midnight pay raises slipped in in the back rooms to an otherwise popular bill, hoping to slip it by the process that would expose it to debate and allow Members to vote up or down and have their constituents know what their vote was. I am pleased that this measure has now been adopted into law and is part of the Constitution of the United States so that no longer will we be allowed to raise or adjust our pay without exposing it to the light of debate and putting our yeas and nays in public for the public to judge us on. I introduced a measure to reform the way in which we judge each other and I introduced a measure that would return this body from one of a professional body to a citizen legislature, which I believe our Founding Fathers intended. Finally, I introduced a measure guaranteeing that the Congress would live under the same laws it passes for everyone else. Significantly, we are here today debating that fourth measure. It is the worst, most obvious hypocrisy, for the Senate to pass legislation that applies to every other American except for those who wrote the legislation. It sets the Congress apart as a privileged elite, unbound by normal rules and standards. And it protects the Congress from the consequences of its own failures and excessive burdens. This measure, this one that we are debating today and will vote on—this measure ensures that public laws would be applied to public servants. Anything less is a dangerous double standard. From the Clean Air Act, which I supported, to the Americans With Disabilities Act, to OSHA regulations, to labor standards, to civil rights laws, Congress will be forced to come into compliance with the very laws that Congress has passed and imposed on the citizens Congress was elected to serve. Knowing that Congress must comply with laws that it considers, hopefully we will write better laws or perhaps maybe no law at all. I fully ex pect that we will be overwhelmed and in many cases simply unable to comply with the laws already on the books. The basement of the Capitol alone will be enough to employ a team of OSHA inspectors in perpetuity. Yet, if it is impossible for us to comply, perhaps we will finally understand the extent of the burden which we have placed on American citizens. Our citizens and families, small businesses, the lifeblood of jobs in America, are suffering under the weight of unprecedented Government intrusion into the very way they live their lives and do their work. The premise is simple enough. We will write better laws if we are forced to live under those laws. If it is impossible to comply with the law, we should not write it. With a vote earned by the sacrifice of so many Americans, the American people have staged a second American revolution. The Congressional Accountability Act is the first measure in fulfilling the promise of that revolution for future generations of Americans. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Indiana has expired. Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota is recognized for up to 20 minutes. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me be very clear. I said this yesterday and I want to say it again to my colleagues, I am very supportive of this Congressional Accountability Act. I think this piece of legislation should and must be passed. That is why I did not want this to be open- ended. I wanted this debate to be within a reasonable period of time. But if we are going to say that we are trying to make the Congress—the Senate accountable, we can do much better. There is no reason why we cannot strengthen this piece of legislation. We do that all the time on the floor of the Senate. That is the very essence of our accountability. Senators come out with amendments to strengthen a piece of legislation and we vote on those amendments up or down and then we are held accountable for our votes. This amendment was part of a campaign finance reform bill which was passed June 17, 1993, I guess at 2:11 p.m. This was the vote: 60 yeas, 38 nays. This amendment was part of this piece of legislation that was passed by many Senators who now still serve in this body. These arguments, and really they are smokescreen arguments, about the ACLU—colleagues come out and say, ‘‘The ACLU said this, therefore we better not vote for it.’’ I have to smile, because I have never in the past noticed that was the litmus test for my colleagues, that the ACLU took a position therefore that is our position. That is a smokescreen argument. One more time, Mr. President. If we want to talk about, agree or disagree with one of the major Court decisions about this whole issue of campaign finance, it was Buckley versus Valeo. It was made crystal clear by the Court VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES538 January 6, 1995 that any potential infringement on first amendment speech rights has to be balanced against concerns about corruption or the appearance of corruption. I want to say to my colleagues, I am not talking about corruption. I am talking about the appearance of corruption. What this amendment says— and I went over it very carefully this morning—is that if a lobbyist comes into your office to see you or staff, then at least a year ought to go by before that lobbyist contributes money to you or instructs a client to do so. Or if a lobbyist, or a client instructed by a lobbyist, a PAC instructed by a lobbyist, contributes money to you in your race—I say that to those Senators who have just come to the Senate—a year ought to go by before that lobbyist is allowed to come in and lobby you. We voted for this before. There was strong support for it before. We are talking about congressional accountability. If my colleagues think they can hide behind a smokescreen argument—you know, different Senators have different views about how to interpret legislation. Of course someone can stand up and say the ACLU says it is not constitutional, therefore it is not constitutional. Many of us voted for it before. And I would think that many of my colleagues who ran on a reform agenda, who said they were interested in reform, would vote for it now. I do not think we should trivialize this issue. We are focusing on congressional accountability. We are focusing specifically on an essential problem with the way Government operates. I have heard a lot about the way Government operates. If we want the Government to operate in such a way that the citizens we represent back in our States feel that Government is open and accountable and responsive to them, and not just those folks who march on Washington every day—that is to say who are here every day, well heeled, well oiled, well financed, with lobbyists, having way too much access and say—then certainly we can break this link. This is an extremely modest amendment. I am astounded, frankly, that there is any real opposition to it. I really am. Mr. President, yesterday I came out on the floor with Senator LEVIN, Senator FEINGOLD, and Senator LAUTENBERG. And we said at the very beginning of the session, let us send a strong message to the people we represent. As long as we are talking about congressional accountability, let us pass an amendment that focuses on prohibiting the taking of these gifts, trips to the Bahamas or Hawaii paid for by whomever; meals, tickets, you name it; not because we think that Senators or Representatives are corrupt—we do not believe that, we are proud of being in the Senate—but because we know that the people we represent—I have heard this standard over and over again; I have heard Senators announce this standard on the floor—we know that the people we represent do not receive those gifts and it is inappropriate. It is really unacceptable. Let it go. Yesterday the vote was against that amendment. Really the only argument I heard was the control argument. We are in control. We are in control here, and therefore there are not going to be any amendments on this bill. It was not the merit of the amendment. It did not have anything to do with at the beginning of the session making it clear to people we were for reform. It was control. Well, Senators did not vote for that. Today I have an amendment that says at the very minimum, if we are going to talk about reform and accountability, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I think it sends a very positive signal to the people we represent, which is we are not going to take one thing while we campaign, and then vote against it on the floor of the Senate. We are not going to hide behind the ACLU. We vote it up or down. We are not going to hide behind a control issue. Our party is in power; therefore, we are not accepting any amendments. I have even heard some of my colleagues say—I think, I do not have the particular day or time—that campaign finance reform is off the agenda this Congress. Mr. President, it is not off the agenda. The reason it is not off the agenda is that each and every Senator has a right to come to the floor with amendments that focus in on what a Senator believes are important issues to the people he or she represents. I happen to believe that for Minnesotans this is an extremely important issue. By the way, not that polls always make the difference. I actually hope they do not because I hope every Senator votes his or her conscience when that is the case. But if you were to do a poll in the cafes of Minnesota as to whether or not we ought to vote for an amendment to put an end to this sort of insidious connection between the lobbying and the giving and the taking of money with at least a not outright prohibition but at least a 1- year moratorium, 99.9999 percent of the people in Minnesota would agree. What is the hesitation? Why would my colleagues be opposed to it? Mr. President, I had actually looked forward to more debate on this. So far we have heard about the American Civil Liberties Union’s position and that is it. So I have to assume that is the reason my colleagues are going to vote against this, if they are going to vote against this. I have not heard another Senator come to the floor with any other substantive reason given for voting against this amendment. I can tell you, Mr. President, in the spirit of accountability—and we are talking a congressional accountability act—I would think Senators would be clear as to why they are opposed. I have not heard that. And in the ab sence of hearing that opposition, though one Senator, Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky certainly spoke against it, I look forward to this vote and I believe that this amendment should be passed by the Senate. And certainly as to those Senators who voted for this campaign finance reform bill, which included this amendment before, I look forward to their support and the support of some of my colleagues who are new to this Senate whom I know are very strong reformers. Mr. President, I conclude my remarks and yield the rest of my time. I think we are going to have a motion to table at 1:45. So I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro ceeded to call the roll. Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

Mr. President, before the vote on this amendment I just would like to be very direct with my colleagues. This amendment speaks to a very real problem. Mr. President, this amendment is not an abstract amendment. It does speak to a very real problem. We are talking about part of the political culture in Washington. Let me lay it on the line at the very end, because that is what this amendment is about. I will just lay it on the line. It is not uncommon for a Senator to be lobbied by a registered lobbyist and a month later to get a $5,000 PAC check. It happens. Let me just be very blunt and direct at the very end of this debate. The reason that I introduced this amendment as part of the campaign finance reform bill—and that bill got overwhelming support in the Senate—and the reason I bring this amendment today as part of the Congressional Accountability Act VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S539 January 6, 1995 is that this happens. Let us get away from all of the abstract arguments. The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that all too often lobbyists come in to see a Senator, and shortly thereafter the money flows in. All too often, lobby money flows into campaigns, and shortly thereafter lobbyists and groups and organizations represented by lobbyists appear. That is egregious. That does not give people confidence in this process. That does not make the Congress very accountable to the many. That is what this amendment is all about. Mr. President, I simply say to my colleagues that if you are serious about reform, then this amendment is a test case of that commitment to reform. I do not know how any of us can go back to any of the cafes or restaurants in our own States and justify to people how we voted for the continuation of this practice. We ought to end it. It is a good Government reform. It is part of congressional accountability, and I urge my colleagues—urge my colleagues—to support this amendment. They have in the past. Many of my colleagues found this to be a compelling problem and issue in the past. It is just as compelling today. I yield the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unan imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support campaign finance reform legislation and I have cosponsored it repeatedly over the years only to have it filibustered or vetoed by the other party. For me, taken outside the context of campaign finance reform, this amendment is problematic. It would prohibit a Senator from receiving support from lobbyists but it would not prevent a challenger from receiving contributions from those very same lobbyists. Yet that challenger could be an incumbent—a Governor, a State legislator, a mayor—and not be subject to the same restrictions. In my most recent campaign, I was challenged by the speaker of the house in the New Jersey State Legislature. I can tell you that he had the ability, based on his contact with various groups and issues, to raise a lot of money from lobbyists and special interest groups. So, without a comprehensive campaign finance program in place, the prohibition in this amendment singles out incumbent Senators— not all incumbents—unfairly. Further, comprehensive campaign finance reform set a limit on the total amount of money one could spend on a campaign. So even if a challenger could receive funds from lobbyists while an incumbent could not, the limit on total spending would not necessarily create an uneven playing field. In an environment of unlimited spending, however, denying one candidate resources which are available to another is not equitable. I support the goal of the Wellstone amendment—to break the link between contributors and any real, or perceived, influence on public policy. We can best achieve that goal in the context of overall reform of our campaign finance system. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY.

The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. f THE GIFT BAN AMENDMENT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, during the last session of Congress, I was a cosponsor of the gift ban bill and was among a handful of Republicans who voted for cloture on the conference report. Nevertheless, I voted to table the gift ban amendment to the Congressional Accountability Act. Congress has been severely criticized for passing legislation that applies one set of rules to itself and a separate set of rules to the rest of the Nation. The Congressional Accountability Act changes that practice, once and for all. The House already has agreed to similar legislation and is expected to endorse the Senate version. Passage of the gift ban bill would delay final approval of this important measure. Furthermore, passage of a ban on gifts from lobbyists prior to consideration and passage of strict lobbying disclosure requirements is, in my view, shortsighted. The majority leader clearly stated his intention to address the entire issue of how lobbyists interact with Members of Congress and their staffs. Banning gifts from lobbyists should be addressed in that context. To ban gifts from lobbyists under our present inadequate system of registering lobbyists could act as a disincentive to proper registration. Mr. GLENN.

The Sen ator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Is this an amend ment, Mr. President, that would mandate that the next budget resolution that is presented to the U.S. Senate must show a balance? Mr. EXON. In answer to my friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, the amendment that I am sending to the desk outlines a series of procedures that I think are absolutely necessary to make sure that the balanced budget amendment, which I support, can be fully operative in a reasonable period of time. Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unani mous-consent question is pending. Is there objection? Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO. 6 (Purpose: To apply the balanced budget amendment to Congress) Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. EXON] proposes an amendment numbered 6. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following: SEC. .—CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET. (a) PURPOSE.—The Congress declares it es sential that the Congress— (1) adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced Federal budget; (2) set forth with specificity in the first session of the 104th Congress the policies that achieving such a balanced Federal budget would require; and (3) enforce through the congressional budget process the requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget. (b) POINT OF ORDER AGAINST BUDGET RESOLUTIONS THAT FAIL TO SET FORTH A GLIDE PATH TO A BALANCED BUDGET.—Section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting at the end thereof the following new subsection: ‘‘(j) CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET.—It shall not be in order to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget (or amendment, motion, or conference report thereon) that— ‘‘(A) fails to set forth appropriate levels for all items described in subsection (a)(1) through (7) for all fiscal years through 2002; ‘‘(B) sets forth a level of outlays for fiscal year 2002 or any subsequent fiscal year that exceeds the level of revenues for that fiscal year; or ‘‘(C) relies on the assumption of either— ‘‘(i) reductions in direct spending, or ‘‘(ii) increases in revenues, without includ ing specific reconciliation instructions under section 310 to carry out those assumptions.’’. (c) REQUIREMENT FOR 60 VOTES TO WAIVE OR APPEAL IN THE SENATE.—Section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘301(i),’’ in both places that it appears. (d) SUSPENSION IN THE EVENT OF WAR OR CONGRESSIONALLY DECLARED LOW GROWTH.— Section 258(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘sections’’. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senate is not in order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order and will Senators remove conversations from the floor. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are here today considering the worthwhile and laudable goal of applying to the Congress the laws by which all other Americans live. I wholeheartedly support this endeavor and, I might add, it is long overdue. But, in all of the discussions, many may have lost sight of the fact that the single most significant law that we are going to apply to the American people this year is an amendment to the Constitution to require a balanced Federal budget. I rise today to offer an amendment that would apply to the Congress itself a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. Simply put, my amendment would create a point of order against considering any budget resolution that fails to comply with the requirements set out in the balanced budget amendment. In other words, under my amendment, it would be out of order to consider any resolution that failed to show a balance in the fiscal year 2002. That is what the balanced budget amendment requires. No more and no less. My amendment will force the Congress to live up to the policy statement it will set forth in the balanced budget amendment, which I am confident will be adopted sometime this year. Mr. President, I want to put my colleagues on notice, if anyone is for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution—truly for it—he or she should be for my amendment, too. My amendment merely forces Congress to abide by the balanced budget amendment in its budget resolutions. There are no gray areas in this amendment. Specifically, my amendment creates a point of order against consideration of a budget resolution that would not: First, reach a balance in 2002; second, provide at least the usual budget resolution detail; and third, include reconciliation instructions to the affected committees for all entitlement and tax changes assumed. My amendment requires 60 votes to waive the point of order. This is real enforcement. My amendment applies the same standards before 2002 that a balanced budget amendment would apply to after the year 2002. My amendment is also sensible. It provides that the new point of order, just like other points of order under the Budget Act, will be suspended if the Congress declares war or adopts a resolution certifying low economic growth, using the existing procedures under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings measure. Now, some might say to me: ‘‘Just wait until the balanced budget amendment comes up in a couple of weeks.’’ Mr. President, with due respect, that is just not good enough. That is not good enough for the people of the United States of America. That is not good enough for this Senator who has come to the floor of the Senate year after year seeking passage of a balanced budget amendment, only to come away empty handed. To uphold our responsibility to the American people on the eve of the near certain passage of a constitutional amendment, we must have the guarantee before—and I emphasize, Mr. President, before—we vote on the balanced budget amendment itself that we are going to guarantee the specifics of how to reach a balanced budget. Without that, our action would be only a concept and not a plan. Without that, our action would be a politically palatable sham. Without that assurance, we would merely be voting for an idea of a balanced budget, conveniently leaving in the never, never, Alice-in- Wonderland future the enforcement mechanisms that are essential to getting us there. Without that guarantee, we are adults promising a bridge to fantasyland without pillars or even preliminary plans. Some may say we can only do so much deficit reduction at any one time. To them I say that my amendment does not force Congress to put all of its deficit reduction in 1 year. Under my amendment, Congress may even choose to delay action on deficit reduction into the year 2001 or 2002. But my amendment forces Congress to choose. It must lay out some plan to get us to a balance. Let me add, we cannot afford to delay. Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office issued a brief preliminary report on the state of the deficit. I had been advised of this previously, and it has come to pass. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that report be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mr. EXON. Let me just note a few highlights that are quite evident from that report. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that unless we take action right now, the deficit will rise to $322 billion in the year 2002. In order to balance the budget between now and then, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that we will need to achieve some $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if we add into the plan tax cuts in the Republican-controlled Contract With America and, to a lesser extent, the tax cuts suggested by the President of the United States, that figure will easily exceed $1.5 trillion in cuts that we are going to have to make between now and then.

To achieve this herculean task, we must begin to act now. Maybe we are already too late. To quote the CBO report: If the budget is to be balanced by the year 2002, it is vitally important that Congress and the President begin immediately to put into effect policy that will achieve that goal. That, Mr. President, is what my amendment is all about. My amendment will force Congress to start dealing with this challenge now, not in the year 2002. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may choose to vote against requiring compliance with a balanced budget, but make no mistake they will have to vote, they will have to go on record, and if Senators vote against my amendment today we will know that they are in favor of the idea of a balanced budget but they are not for the reality of a balanced budget amendment. Mr. President, I believe that this is a critical time. We are at a juncture where we have the responsibility to show the American people that there is more to our commitment to balance the Federal budget than simply words and phrases, and passing the amendment. I suggest that it is time we showed some courage, as difficult as that is going to be, some responsibility and some constructive definitive action. Mr. President, I yield the floor. EXHIBIT 1 THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ECONOMIC AND BUDGET OUTLOOK: FISCAL YEARS 1996– 2000—A PRELIMINARY REPORT, JANUARY 5, 1995 In late January, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will publish ‘‘The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1996–2000.’’ That volume will provide a detailed analysis of the economic and budget situation facing the nation. Because the 104th Congress plans to consider economic and budget policies during January, however, CBO is releasing this summary of the forecast, estimates, and projections that will be discussed in the forthcoming report. In brief, there have been no fundamental changes in the economic and budget outlook since CBO’s last baseline revisions were released in August 1994. The economy may be a bit more robust in 1995 than was anticipated in August, but a likely slowdown in growth in 1996 leaves the current economic projection for 1999 little different from that which was expected in August. Since CBO’s August projections, the short- run outlook for the deficit has deteriorated modestly, but the longer-run picture is essentially unchanged. Higher-than-anticipated interest payments and lower revenues—only partially offset by reduced medical care costs—have pushed up the deficit projections for fiscal years 1995 through 1999 by an average of almost $25 billion a year. CBO now projects that the deficit will be $176 billion in 1995, rising to $207 billion in 1996. CBO’s less detailed longer-term projections (for 2001 through 2005) indicate, however, that the deficits after 2002 will be somewhat lower than those that CBO projected in August. The currently projected deficit for 2002— the first year that a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget could go into effect—is $322 billion. CBO has devised an illustrative path to a balanced budget in 2002 that is composed of deficit reduction totaling $1.2 trillion over the 1996– 2002, an amount that would require major changes in current policies. The Economic Outlook CBO expects that the strong business investment and personal consumption of durable goods that spurred the economy to a 4.0 percent real rate of growth in 1994 will continue into the first part of 1995 (see Table 1). The 3.1 percent rate of growth forecast for 1995 is lower than the rate in 1994 but is slightly higher than that anticipated last August. Because CBO estimates that the economy is already operating close to potential, such growth is expected to result in somewhat higher inflation and interest rates. In turn, those higher interest rates are likely to slow growth by the end of the year—cutting it to 1.8 percent in 1996 but dampening inflationary pressures. In CBO’s longer-term projections, annual average growth is close to the estimated 2.4 percent rate of growth for potential gross domestic product (GDP), inflation averages 3.4 percent, and interest rates are lower than in 1995 and 1996. The Budget Outlook CBO projects that the deficit will decline from the $203 billion registered in 1994 to $176 billion in 1995, or 2.5 percent of GDP (see Table 2). The deficit’s decline in 1995 is not as great as anticipated last August when CBO projected a deficit of $162 billion for that year (see Table 3). Very little of the reestimate for 1995 or other years is the result of legislation adopted since the last baseline. Instead, higher interest rates have increased projected federal interest costs, and lower wage and salary income has led to slightly lower revenue estimates. Changes in projections that cannot be attributed to legislation or to changes in the economic forecast are called technical reestimates. One such reestimate is a reduction in projected revenues to reflect slightly lower-than-expected tax collections in 1994. In addition, the costs of Medicare and Medicaid have been reestimated downward since August to reflect lower-than-expected spending for Medicaid in 1994 and the slowdown that is occurring in the growth of health care cost. Deficits are expected to rise after 1995—to $421 billion in 2005, or 3.6 percent of GDP (for projections of revenues, outlays, and deficits for 1995 through 2005, see Table 4). Those projections assume that current policies governing taxes and mandatory spending remain unchanged. They also assume that discretionary spending is consistent with the statutory limits on appropriations (both for general purpose spending and for spending from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund) that are in effect through 1998, and that discretionary spending grows at the rate of inflation after that. See Table 5 for a comparison of that baseline with one constructed using identical assumptions, except that after 1998 discretionary spending is frozen at the dollar level of the 1998 cap. Table 6 shows the projected outlays for the major components of mandatory spending, which are the same in both baselines. Illustrative Path to a Balanced Budget A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget will be considered during the early days of the 104th Congress. If the Congress adopts such an amendment this year and it is ratified by three-quarters of the state legislatures in the next few years, the requirement could apply to the budget for fiscal year 2002. If the budget is to be balanced by 2002, it is vitally important that the Congress and the President begin immediately to put into effect policies that will achieve that goal. According to CBO’s latest projections of a baseline that assumes inflation adjustments for discretionary spending after 1998, some combination of spending cuts and tax increases totaling $322 billion in 2002 would be needed to eliminate the deficit in that year. The amounts of deficit reduction called for in the years preceding 2002 depend both on the exact policies adopted and on when the process is started. For illustrative purposes, CBO has devised one possible path leading to a balanced budget in 2002 (see Table 7). Starting from the baseline that assumes an inflation adjustment for discretionary spending after 1998 (see Table 4), that path first shows the savings that would be achieved if discretionary spending were instead frozen at the dollar level of the 1998 cap through 2002. Such a freeze, along with the resulting debt-service effects, would produce $89 billion of the required savings of $322 billion in 2002. Under this freeze policy, the buying power of total discretionary appropriations in 2002 would be approximately 20 percent lower than in 1995. CBO also built into the illustrative path a possible course of savings from further policy changes. The amounts of those savings are not based on the adoption of any particular set of policies, but they do assume that policy changes are phased in between 1996 and 1999 in a pattern that is similar to the changes in mandatory spending enacted in the last two reconciliation acts. After 1999, the assumed savings increase at the baseline rate of growth for entitlement and other mandatory spending, excluding Social Security. Such a pattern of savings implies that the cuts implemented in earlier years are permanent and that no additional policy changes are made. If those savings were achieved entirely out of entitlement and other mandatory programs (excluding Social Security), they would represent about a 20 percent reduction from current-policy levels for those programs. Over the entire 1996–2002 period, the savings in CBO’s illustrative path that result directly from policy changes total more than $1 trillion (in relation to a baseline that includes an inflation adjustment for discretionary spending after 1998). When the resulting savings in debt-service payments are included, the total exceeds $1.2 trillion. Conclusion CBO’s most recent economic and budget projections underscore the challenge that will face policymakers who may have to enact the spending cuts or tax increases needed to balance the budget by 2002. Although, the long-term budget outlook is no worse now than it was last August, the new projections reinforce the fact that the deficit can be eliminated only through major changes in current policies.

The exact path depends on when the deficit reduction begins and the specific policies adopted by the Congress and the Presi dent. This path is not based on any specific policy assumptions, but does assume policies are fully phased in by 1999. d Less than $500 million. Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, first let me say to my friend, Senator EXON, who will become the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I truly welcome you sitting with me in the Budget Committee. You will be right next to me, and I am hopeful that what you are saying here today in the Chamber means—and I believe it does—that as we try to put together a major deficit reduction package in the next 8 to 9 weeks, you will be here and that you will be at my side as we try to do that. I want to say to the Senate and the public, the Senate Budget Committee intends to make a very significant downpayment on a balanced budget. I do not believe in the very first budget resolution that we propose that we can be expected to get to a balanced budget. First of all, we have not adopted the constitutional amendment. That means the President of the United States is not bound by it, because until we have that, which would then become the law of the land, the President does not have to give us a balanced budget format. We are on our own. I wish to submit to the Senate, if we come up with a budget deficit package, I say to Senator NICKLES, that is anywhere from a $400 to $450 billion reduction over the game plan that is in existence right now, that will be a historic budget. It will start to make Government smaller. It will start to change the underlying law of the land so that instead of going up, the budget deficit will be down and down permanently—perhaps, perhaps, I say to my friend, the occupant of the chair, down as close as $100 billion 5 years from now, where today it is expected to be over $300 billion. Now, I submit all of that can be done if the Senate wants to do it. And while I commend my friend from Nebraska, who is dedicated and devoted to a constitutional amendment and balance, while I submit that we are also, I do not believe we ought to be legislating how we implement a constitutional amendment here on the floor of the Senate with a 15-minute introduction of a major bill and 15 minutes to discuss it. This sounds more like what the Congress of the United States will be engaged in once the States send us this constitutional amendment and say it is the law of the land. Then obviously that amendment says implement that by statute law. This sounds more like an advanced implementation done here in the Chamber of the Senate with no hearings and no discussion. I do not say that in any way to denigrate the seriousness that Senator EXON, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, places on this issue. It is important. It is important that we not send mixed signals to the public. If we send them a constitutional amendment, we ought to make a very large downpayment, major downpayment, on that deficit in this very first budget resolution. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office is warning us today and confirming what some of us on this side have been saying that the last package of so- called deficit reduction efforts did not get the deficit down. It did for a very short period of time. But the underlying basic laws of the land were not changed enough, so that it is going back up again. Our pledge is that in our first resolution we will change that trend by forcing substantive law to be changed, and we will put everything on the table, fellow Senators. We do not need this proposal. We are going to put everything there except Social Security. And we are entitled to a reasonable period of time—3 months—to see if we can do that. We do not need to change the Budget Act or change the rules, implement a constitutional amendment on the floor of the Senate. Having said that, I understand this matter is debatable, but I would like to make a point of order, unless somebody wants to speak, in which event I will withhold that, but it clearly violates the Budget Act and requires 60 votes from what I understand. I see my friend, Senator NICKLES, standing. Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator withhold before he makes the point of order—— Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to withhold. Mr. NICKLES. So I can address the Senate for a few minutes? Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Oklahoma has the floor. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator DOMENICI for his statement and also I compliment our colleague from Nebraska for his bill. I was hoping in a way it would be a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. But I just tell my colleague from Nebraska, who is now the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I think the Budget Act should be amended. I will work with him to amend it. I do not think it should be amended on the floor of the Senate today. We do not have to pass—I just make mention to my colleagues—we do not have to pass every amendment that might be around in our first week in session. I know there are ideas on campaign reform. There are ideas on lobbying reform. I hope the majority would like to pass a bill to make Congress abide by the laws like everyone else in the country. The House has already passed it and the Senate has not. I really would like the Senate to pass it. I introduced it in 1991. We did not win that time. I remember at that time the majority leader was Senator Mitchell. He spoke out very vigorously and he convinced a lot of people and we lost. I would really like to pass it. I would like to pass it clean. I am interested in amending the Budget Act. I think our budget procedures do not work very well and one of the things I would like to change is our baseline so we do not have inflated baselines. That is something, now, that has gained some popularity. Maybe that can be in part of our Budget Act Resolution. There are some other things we can do in the Budget Act, I think, that also would make sense. When the Senator from Nebraska says that any budget resolution should move us on a path towards a balanced budget, I may well support that. Maybe a direct path. We can negotiate that. But I think the Budget Act probably needs some amendments and I will be happy to work with my colleague from Nebraska to make that happen. I know there are some other amendments that need to be made to the Budget Act in addition to this that is before us today. This particular amendment does not have anything to do with making Congress abide by the laws like everybody else. There are 11 statutes from which Congress has exempted itself, going all the way back to 1935, and we are trying to remedy that. I know colleagues have amendments: We want to ban lobbying; we want to ban gifts; we want to ban this, and try to correct everything that can possibly be wrong in our first week in session.

We are going to be in session the following week. The majority leader has already said we can take up several of these issues soon. The Senator from New Mexico said we are going to take up a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We are going to take up implementing legislation. We are going to take up a budget resolution. That happens by statute. It has to happen, I believe, by April 15. We have to pass a joint resolution implementing the budget resolution. So this is going to happen. It does not have to happen today. So the intent of my colleague from Nebraska, I think, is well made. But I hope we will defer it, or postpone it, and let us look at rewriting the Budget Act. Let us not do it on this bill. Let us pass this bill as it is. I would like to pass it today. Let us send it to the President and get his signature on it. I think it would be a positive accomplishment for this Congress and for this President. I yield the floor and I thank my colleague from New Mexico for yielding to me. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Exon amendment to balance the budget. I am a longtime proponent of balancing the Federal budget and I believe the most effective manner to do this is through an honest budgeting process. This amendment will require truth in budgeting. I wish to add, however, that my support for a balanced budget is contingent on the exemption of the Social Security trust fund from its enforcement. An overwhelming majority of Americans support a balanced budget amendment but not at the expense of our Nation’s senior citizens. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I failed to mention one other argument I would like to lay before the Congress. I say to my good friend, as soon as the constitutional amendment is adopted by the sovereign States and remitted as it must under the Constitution, and it becomes the sovereign law of the land, there is a very different dynamic that takes place that we do not have today. That is, we will not be the only part of this Government that has to produce a budget resolution that is in balance because, by that time, the President of the United States will have to submit one. The Congress of the United States and the President will be bound by the same generic sovereign law of the land, and I believe we are going to move ahead with a very substantial, large downpayment, probably far in excess of what the President will submit, as our first efforts in the committee. Having said that, Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending amendment violates the Budget Act of the United States. Mr. EXON. addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive section 306 of the act for the purpose of my amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank very much my great friend and colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and my friend from Oklahoma, who is also an important member of the Budget Committee, for the kind statements. We have worked together on many, many things in the past. I assure my chairman of the Budget Committee that I will be there with him, I think as he knows. That does not mean we are always going to agree on every detail. But I think over the years, we have demonstrated the fact that while we might disagree on some of the details, I am not certain that our goals have been very significantly different. Back to the devil in the details—if we pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, then the devil will be in the details. What I am trying to do is to get a jump start on that. The chairman of the Budget Committee has indicated that we should not bring this up on this particular bill. This is such a far-reaching bill that we cannot have a 15-minute debate, without any hearings, and then come to a conclusion. I am prepared to debate this for whatever length of time is necessary. I do not think we can only debate this for 15 minutes. There are no time agreements that this Senator is aware of at the present time. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator KOHL of Wisconsin be added as original cosponsor to the amendment that I have offered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee seems to be saying, in one form or another, that we will comply with the balanced budget amendment at some later date. That is just what I am concerned about. Why wait? We all know, as evidenced by what happened in the House of Representatives earlier this week, that a balanced budget amendment of some form is going to come over here; 80 percent of the people of the United States, in several polls that I have seen, indicate that they support a balanced budget amendment. Therefore, I think it is very clear that we are going to have a balanced budget amendment before us and I intend to vote for it. We only lost by, if I remember, two or three votes on obtaining the required two-thirds in the last session of the Senate. So it is a foregone conclusion that this is going to come to pass. I am very much concerned, though, when I hear my chairman of the Budget Committee talking about a downpayment, a significant downpayment on the budget. I have just cited the CBO report that indicates over 5 years, the budget deficit is going to be $130 billion to $150 billion more than previously anticipated. I cited in my opening statement the fact that the Congressional Budget Office has said that at a minimum, we are going to have to cut $1.2 trillion from the budget by the year 2002. We are probably going to have some kind of a politically popular middle-class tax cut, which will easily swell that to $1.5 trillion. So I simply say this is not a time to wait. The $500 billion downpayment that is referenced by the chairman of the Budget Committee took a lot of hard work. But it lacks, as far as I know, any real specifics at this time. That is what I am concerned about. We are going to rush to the passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget without anyone having any idea of the roadmap and the detail we are going to have to use to get there. As I said in my opening statement, it is like building a bridge to fantasy land without specifying any pillars, and without even specifying any hastily sketched plan as to what the bridge is going to look like. It seems to me that, as the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, the Budget Committee of Republicans and Democrats, we have a responsibility, if indeed we are for a balanced budget amendment, which I think most of the Members of this body are, that in doing so we have the responsibility— that is what the Budget Committee is all about—to study and to bring back the details of how we are going to reach that goal, at least in some specific a fashion, as much as possible. What we have to do, it seems to me, is to show the way, to be specific. I do not think we can wait. If I had some assurance that the amendment that I have offered would be considered in an up or down majority vote sometime in the immediate future, then I might not be pressing this today. However, I have a strong belief that the more we delay in doing what the Exon amendment says we have to do, the more we are going to be suspect in the eyes of the American people. I am afraid that many of the American people would think passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget will just take care of everything. I say to the Chair and I say to my colleagues, the easiest thing in the world VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S547 January 6, 1995 to do is to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget which everybody would say amen to; 80 percent of the people in the United States and probably 60 to 80 percent of the Members of the Congress would say that is a great idea without fully understanding the difficult role that all are going to have to play in getting from here to there by the year 2002. One thing that comes to mind, Mr. President, very clearly is the indication of the chairman of the Budget Committee and I compliment Senator DOMENICI for the hard work he did in coming up at least with some figures in the $400 billion to $500 billion range. But that is over a 5-year period. If we would accept that and if the balanced budget amendment is ratified by the States, which I presume it would be, and if we go along with what is recommended by the chairman of the Budget Committee, then at best we would be less than halfway and maybe only a third of the way to the $1.2 to $1.5 trillion realistic amount of cuts that we are going to have to make to get there. I simply say, Mr. President, by opposing this amendment, I think we are sending far more mixed signals to the people of the United States as to where the Congress is going and where it is not going and probably how serious we are about passing a politically popular constitutional amendment to balance the budget. On the subject of hearings, that has been brought up, let me note specifically for the record that this body passed a very famed Gramm-Rudman- Hollings. We saw that come to the floor of the U.S. Senate without 1 minute of hearing. I simply say that a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget has been discussed. Hearings were held on it for a long, long time. It is not a particularly complicated piece of legislation in and of itself. It just creates a constitutional amendment that has to be passed by both bodies and sent to the States where 75 percent of the States would have to ratify that before it becomes law. I simply say that if we passed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings way back in 1985 without hearings, which in some ways was a very complicated piece of legislation, then we do not have to have more hearings on this subject because we know we are going to pass it anyway. Certainly, I must say that I believe the chairman of the Budget Committee is very sincere in his belief. But this is one of those cases that I indicated earlier which it just so happens that good friends who I think are working in the same direction do not agree on how fast we should move. The chairman of the Budget Committee wants to wait for ratification of the constitutional amendment seemingly before we do anything more dynamic than the $400 to $500 billion grab bag of reductions that have been suggested. I know the chairman has worked very hard on those. I do not mean to say that his task was not sincere. I do say, though, that if all we are going to do is to come up with $500 billion in possible savings, then if we are going to wait around for the States to ratify, the months and years are going to go by and then the next Congress of the United States and maybe the one after that or the one after that will be facing a 2-year period between the year 2000 and the year 2002 when they are going to have to cut $1 trillion or somewhere in that area over and beyond, assuming we enact all of the cuts of the roughly $500 billion that has been named in one fashion or another by the chairman of the Budget Committee. I think more than anything else, Mr. President, that demonstrates the need that, if we are sincere about this, we have to do much more than the timely work that has been done by the chairman of the Budget Committee with the reference to the $400 to $500 billion that has been identified loosely in one fashion or another. I am afraid that we cannot wait. We must not wait or we are going to send the signal to the American people that after their States ratify a constitutional amendment, then we will get on with our business of balancing the budget. If we are sincere, then I think we should start making recommendations now, making cuts now that we know we are going to have to do anyway. I simply say that putting off the hard choices until after a constitutional provision is ratified by the States would be a step in the wrong direction. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma says that there is nothing in my amendment dealing with applying the laws of Congress. What greater law is there in applying laws of Congress to the laws that we have imposed on the people than offering them a constitutional amendment but then saying but we are not going to get into the details of this until you make your determination? I happen to believe that the Budget Committee, the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the Senate Budget Committee, respective bodies have an obligation to spell out in as much detail as we possibly can what it is going to take, what the sacrifices are that are going to have to be made to reach the balanced budget by the year 2002. That is why I said in my opening statement that unless we do something more than what has been done now, I am afraid that we are bringing forth a sham on the American people. Certainly I do not believe that the American people want any more shams. I guess that was one of the conclusions that this one Democratic Senator from a Republican State took from the last election. I, therefore, say delaying the decisions that have to be made is not only unwise and unsound fiscal policy of which we have been on for far too many years, but it is also not satisfactory. It is not carrying out our responsibility to tell the people of the United States of America to tell the legislatures of the 50 sovereign States of the United States and to tell all interested parties how we might be able to get there in the year 2002. I simply say that you do not have to be a mathematical genius to recognize the fact that we are going to twiddle our thumbs and not do more than has been thus far recommended—and again I salute him for the recommendations he has made. But if we are going to sit and twiddle our thumbs for 5 years and say we are going to cut about $500 billion in this fashion, then when and if the States ratify the measure, that Congress, both the Members of the House and the U.S. Senate, are going to be in dire circumstances indeed. And we will be faced with the proposition of either extending the year 2002 to some other date 7 or 8 years into the future beyond that, or they are going to have to make more draconian cuts than they can make in the budget that is still running to a large extent out of hand, and/or they would have to pass such massive tax increases to meet the year 2002 that it would be universally unpopular with 80 or 90 percent of the people of the United States of America. If that is not enough, such a tax increase would certainly send the United States of America into a deep, deep depression, not unlike what some of us remember happened back in the 1930’s. Therefore, I renew my plea, Mr. President, and say that there is nothing revolutionary about the Exon amendment. The Exon amendment is straightforward. I think the amendment, if people sit and study it on both sides of the aisle, could simply be summed up that if you are for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, then you have to be for the Exon amendment or you are not being fully square with the American people. I yield the floor. Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from California is recognized. Mrs. BOXER. May I inquire if we are going to have a recess at the hour of 1 p.m.? The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such order. Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for 7 minutes as in morning business. Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. The Senator is not going to speak on this issue? Mrs. BOXER. Very briefly, in passing, just a sentence to make an observation. But I have a bill I have introduced and I would like to take about 7 minutes to speak about it, if I might. Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say to my friend from California, the majority leader is suggesting that we are almost finished with this amendment and that perhaps you can have that time after we have disposed of this amendment.

I ask, through the Chair, the distinguished majority leader, do we plan on a vote on the Exon amendment this afternoon? Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may—— The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. DOLE. I would say that from the majority leader’s standpoint, I would like to vote on the Exon amendment very quickly. We are supposed to be meeting from 12 to 2 with the Governors. Half of that time has already elapsed and I have yet to show up at the meeting. From a personal standpoint—if we can vote on the Exon amendment, I would be happy to yield whatever time the Senator from California may need or however long the Senator from Arkansas may wish to speak following that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor. Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I compliment Senator EXON and associate myself with his remarks. We have to balance the budget. Mr. President, I request 60 seconds, if I might, at this time to speak on another topic. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California is recog nized. Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. (The remarks of Mrs. BOXER per taining to the introduction of legislation are located in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.’’) Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from Arkansas would like to speak on the amendment, and the Senator from Pennsylvania would like to speak for 3 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that we vote on the motion to waive at 1:05. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. EXON. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec tion is heard. Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to ob ject. I would say to the majority leader that I do not intend a filibustering action on this, but when the chairman of the Budget Committee said something earlier about only having 15 minutes to debate that, that came as a big surprise to me. I do not know, nor did I hear, what the majority leader said a few moments ago about some kind of a vote between 1 or 2 o’clock sometime. I am here ready to debate and do business. I believe there are some other individuals that would very much like the opportunity to possibly come over and say a few words on this. I had not anticipated that we would vote that early. However, I recognize the parliamentary rights of the other side to make a motion to table at any particular time. May I ask of the majority leader, why do we want to vote on this at 1:05 when I have some other things I would like to say on this myself? The Senator from California has indicated some interest in it, as has the Senator from Arkansas. What is the rush to vote by 1:05? Mr. DOLE. There is no rush, but I can move to table right now and we can vote at 12:55. We can always do that. We do not have to wait until 1:05. I am trying to accommodate the Senators on each side, including this Senator, but we will vote at 4 o’clock then. Would that be all right? Mr. EXON. Yes, 4 o’clock is all right. Mr. DOLE. I do not want to vote at 4 o’clock. But we are going to do a lot of work here today. We are not going to have one or two votes today, because we are trying to finish this bill by Monday evening. I do not see any way that is going to happen. I do not have any quarrel with the Senator from Nebraska taking all the time he wishes, up to some reasonable point. At that point, we would move to table. But because he has not had much time for debate—— Mr. EXON. May I say, Mr. President, to the majority leader that certainly I would think that I could agree now to a vote not later than 4 o’clock, with the time between now and then equally divided. We might be able to speed it up, depending on how many want to talk. Mr. DOLE. I would rather not make that request now. I know some Members have other plans this afternoon— not this Member, but other Members on both sides of the aisle—who would like to not only complete this amendment but a couple of others and maybe get an agreement. As I understand it, there will be a meeting at 1 o’clock on the other side to see if we can reach some agreement so those who had amendments could stay and debate them. Those who did not have amendments could keep their commitments, in some cases far away from here. We are trying to accommodate all Senators. So I would not want to wait until 4 o’clock. Why do we not just say we will revisit it in 30 or 45 minutes? Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I understand the difficult task the majority leader has, and I think usually I have cooperated, and I want to cooperate now. He has indicated probably we will not finish this bill today and we may be stacking some votes and vote next week. Mr. DOLE. Next week means next Monday. Probably votes will occur after 3 o’clock. In any event, I know the distinguished minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, will be meeting at 1 o’clock to see how many amendments will be remaining on that side. We are perfectly prepared to reach agreement so that those who have amendments can stay and debate them but not vote. But we would like to vote on this one today. Mr. EXON. I would prefer, frankly, if I could, to stay here and debate this however late and possibly stack the vote on the Exon amendment along with any other votes that the majority leader wishes to stack next week, or whatever is his pleasure. Mr. DOLE. My pleasure would be not to do that. Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to deny the Senator time. And I hope he did not interpret my saying 15 minutes—I had inquired of his staff how long the Senator intended to speak and they said 15 minutes and I, quite inappropriately, assumed that was the extent of the debate. I clearly do not intend to hold anybody to 15 minutes. That is what I understood. Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator. Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COCHRAN). The Senator from Arkansas. Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I had not planned to speak this afternoon. I certainly do not want to obstruct the flow of legislative business here. First, I would like to compliment my colleague and friend from Nebraska on his proposal this afternoon. I also want to say that I cannot support it at this time. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues, Mr. President, the fact that in one section of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, which the Senate this afternoon, in just a few minutes of debate, is going to be asked vote on, states that it is ‘‘essential that Congress, one, adopt a balanced budget amendment.’’ That is one thing that the Exon amendment proposes to do. So we, after a very few moments and a very small skirmish on a very large constitutional issue, Mr. President, are going to be required in a few moments, with many absences—I assume some of our colleagues have gone back to their States, to vote on whether or not we think ‘‘the Congress should adopt a balanced budget amendment.’’ Maybe we think that the Congress should; maybe we think the Congress should not. But this is a very, very far-reaching proposal. Mr. President, my colleague and friend from Nebraska stated in the opening moments of his very eloquent presentation the fact that the American public, by overwhelming numbers, says, yes, we need a balanced budget and we need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I think there was a CBS poll or one of the polling operations that reported today or yesterday that a great majority of those polled say we need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Mr. President, I know there is a great euphoria around the Capitol these VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S549 January 6, 1995 days, but I do not think that euphoria is of such magnitude and intensity and velocity at this moment that the American people might not give us say a few months, a few months, perhaps even in the summer, early fall or October, certainly before we leave, to let us decide whether or not we want to propose to the 50 States that an amendment to the Federal Constitution be adopted to require a balanced budget. The Exon proposal, in my opinion, is a very, very responsible proposal because it will require, Mr. President, the policies to be specified that would be required to enforce a balanced budget amendment or, to say it in another way—I assume I am speaking with some degree of correctness—it would imply that there would have to be implementing legislation that would have to go along with a balanced budget amendment. I think that is a responsible course of action. I think, Mr. President, for us to this afternoon, on Friday, with a short debate, to even take a position on whether we want to, require 60 votes to waive a point of order—that is a new order of consideration provided by the Exon amendment—is questionable. We even go back to a procedure under the old Gramm-Rudman-Hollings concept that provides that the point of order will be suspended if Congress declares war or adopts a resolution certifying low economic growth. This is another question. But the Senator from Nebraska has put his finger on one of the most important things, and that is, do the people want us to vote for a balanced budget amendment before we know the facts? Now, do we know the facts, Mr. President? No, we do not know the facts. When we know the facts, then it will be the proper time and the proper opportunity for us to vote yes or no on whether we prefer a balanced budget amendment to the Federal Constitution. I hope that there will be some way to accommodate the Senator from Nebraska. I wish we could debate this even until next week, because I do not see the necessity to rush an amendment like this through, one of such important consequences, for which I do applaud my colleague and friend from Nebraska. Mr. EXON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague from Arkansas. I will be very brief, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania. I thank the Senator for his very kind remarks and observations. I, too, would like to put off the vote on this until next week, as I indicated in my conversations with the majority leader. There is not anything very revolutionary about this proposal. I would simply explain to the Senator from Arkansas that if we did not pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, that even if we passed the Exon amendment it would have no real effect. The Exon amendment would only have effect if and when we do pass a constitutional amendment. The reason I think it is appropriate to address this now is that we are talking about applying the same rules to the Congress as we do to the people. I think it follows, then, that if we are going to rush pell-mell, as I suggested we are going to do—we are not going to wait several months, I suggest, as the Senator from Arkansas said he would like to see. I think that the first 100 days, maybe the first 10 days, at least the first 10 weeks of this session are going to be very climactic ones and I am very fearful that things are going to be rolled through over here very rapidly. What this Exon amendment does is simply send out the signal that when and if we do pass a constitutional amendment, then we have the responsibility to direct the Budget Committee to come back with some details, rather than passing the amendment and worrying about the details afterwards. I thank my friend from Arkansas for his observations. Mr. President, let me say I just want to correct myself. It does have an effect whether we pass the balanced budget amendment or not. It really says that if we proceed, we proceed in an orderly fashion, which is what the amendment is all about. I yield the floor. Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no disagreement on the floor today about the desirability of having a balanced budget so that the Federal Government would live within its means as every other governmental entity, like the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a constitutional requirement to have a balanced budget. Every city and county in my State and every governmental unit across the country has to live within its means within a balanced budget. Only the Federal Government has the prerogative to print money, script, and borrow and not live within its means. This is an affront to every family, and the comment has often been made on this floor. In the 14 years-plus that I have been in this body, we have debated and talked about this subject, I think, more than any other and there is I think agreement that we need a balanced budget. Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee, we had a very constructive hearing analyzing many legal considerations on enacting a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I think we will soon do that. The amendment proposed by the Senator from Nebraska on its face does something a little different. That is, it ‘‘enforces through the congressional budget process the requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget.’’ The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has raised an understandable objection to this point in tying the hands of the Budget Committee this afternoon with very little debate and only a few Senators on the floor, tying the hands of the Budget Committee on what it will do. I would suggest to the Senator from Nebraska that the preferable course would be for the Senator from Nebraska in his position as the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee to offer the specific amendments to achieve a balanced budget. One of the difficulties in the Senate and the House has been that we have done a lot of talking about the desirability of a balanced budget, but no one has come forward and introduced on the floor the specifics of a balanced budget. So I would say to the Senator from Nebraska, as the ranking member, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, let him come forward with the specifics. He wants a balanced budget. We all do. He thinks he can propose a balanced budget this year. Let him do so. Let him take it to the committee or let him take it to the floor and then we will vote on it. I expect to be a chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee this session on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, a committee I have served on in the 14 years-plus I have been in the Senate, and was ranking member last year. I have already called the Secretaries of each of those departments and have said to them, what are you going to be asking for by way of appropriations next year? What is it that may be eliminated? What is it that we may be able to cut on the budget in terms of specifics? I think there is no doubt that the mandate of last November’s election was that the American people want smaller Government, want reduced spending, and would like to see tax cuts. I believe that we should have tax cuts but I am not prepared to vote for a tax cut sight unseen. I am not prepared to engage in the bidding on a middle-class tax cut until we see that we have savings. I do not think we should have tax cuts if it will add to the deficit. I do think, parenthetically, we should have promptly a capital gains tax cut. That is the one tax cut which we could enact promptly which would not lead to a revenue loss. There were 56 Members of this body in the last session of Congress prepared to have a capital gains tax cut. We could not get it through against a filibuster. That is one tax cut we could have. As to others, we ought not to be in that bidding war until we see what spending cuts we will have. Now, as the prospective chairman of the Subcommittee of Labor, Health, Human Services and Education with a discretionary budget of approximately $70 billion, I am looking for places to cut. But I am not prepared to make cuts VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES550 January 6, 1995 with a meat ax but instead with a scalpel. I am not prepared to talk about the generalizations. I think that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is exactly right when he says, as the chairman with the responsibility to direct those deliberations, that he does not want to see an enforcement mechanism which will compel the Budget Committee to take action before the Budget Committee has a chance to go through the items line by line, which is what the Senator from Arkansas, Senator PRYOR, is in effect saying. What I am saying, is take a look at the specifics of the budget on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, three committees that have discretionary budgets up to $70 billion. The other two provisions in the amendment by the Senator from Nebraska I think are not worthy of adoption. The first one is to adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress, a joint resolution proposing, an amendment to the Constitution requiring, a balanced Federal budget. We are already considering that. It will not do any good to talk any more about that until the Judiciary Committee reports out an amendment and we act on it on the Senate floor. The second line to set forth with specificity in the first session of the 104th Congress is what the policies of achieving such a balanced Federal budget would require. Mr. President, I think we are well aware at this stage of the life of the Congress of what the policies are. I would say that although this matter is worthy of debate it has been on the floor for a little more than an hour. I do not see any avalanche of Senators coming to the floor to debate the resolution. What we ought to be doing at this point is talking about the specifics. Talking about the specifics in my subcommittee and talking about the specifics in the Budget Committee. I would invite the Senator from Nebraska to propose the details as to how he would balance the budget. I can assure that this Senator will look closely at that role and would work with him in trying to balance a budget with real money. Not a confederate proposition of ‘‘let’s talk about it,’’ but let Members be specific about how we will do it. I join him in that effort. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Nebraska Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I certainly thank my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania for his remarks, as much as I disagree with them. Certainly, the Senator from Pennsylvania knows, as I believe the chairman of the Budget Committee knows, and as he has indicated in remarks on this debate this afternoon, that the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee will and is prepared to play a role in developing a list of possibilities that we could come up with. This does not fall solely on one Senator, just as it does not fall on any one Senator as to what is done in the Health and Labor Committee, the Judiciary Committee, or anything else. I would simply say that I will be working with the Republican majority the control of all of the committees and all of the subcommittees to jointly work out something. This is not a sole exercise on any Member’s part. The Exon amendment that is currently before us simply tries to define the difficult task that we have in front of us. It simply says that whether we pass the balanced budget amendment or not, and I think we will, we still have a serious, serious, deficit problem on our hands. I think the Budget Committee should play a key role in this. And in answer to the suggestions of the Senator from Pennsylvania, I will be working very closely with the other members of the Budget Committee, whether or not the Exon amendment is adopted, in the name of fiscal responsibility, where I have been working now, for a long, long time. The Senator from Pennsylvania has remarked on the valuable hearings that the Judiciary Committee has been holding regarding the enforcement of the balanced budget amendment. As he probably noted, and this is also a concern of this Senator, one of the important considerations under that amendment is whether and how the courts— the courts, I emphasize—might enforce the balanced budget amendment. That is one of the reasons that I offered the amendment that I have. I do not think that the courts should be making these decisions. They should be made here in the U.S. Senate and in the House of Representatives. My amendment, contrary to what I am afraid my friend from Pennsylvania thought, helps clear some of that up by mandating that the real congressional enforcement by specifics would be outlined, therefore, keeping, hopefully, endorsement in Congress and out of the courts, where I think none of us thinks it belongs. I think we need to talk specifics. I think we need to talk specifics not as individual Senators but in the Budget Committee, and in the other committees of the Congress that have some jurisdiction. We need to start planning now where we are going to go between now and the year 2002. I object very strenuously to some of the talk that has been carried forth here. With regard to that we do not have to rush into this. We do need to rush in, I suggest, to some kind of a blueprint that would give us some kind of a guide, some kind of an understanding by the people at large on where we are going to go, ask how we are going to get there. Let us make no mistake about it, we have to work together. But let us also make no mistake about it that, as the last election clearly indicates, while the Republicans are in the majority here, I have said time and time again during this debate, and will be saying it in the future, that I will work as a dedicated Member of the loyal opposition, not being an obstructionist but pointing out fiscal responsibility and where I think we should be going, not taking the easy road and simply saying, ‘‘Let’s just go ahead and pass this constitutional amendment to the budget. Then if the States, in their wisdom, 75 percent of them, ratify this, we will get down to the basics.’’ I think that is not the way to go, and I am very fearful that that is the course that we are about to travel. I understand that the minority leader will be on the floor shortly to talk on this subject. I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to fill in a little time, if my colleagues do not object—but when the minority leader comes to the floor, I will cease my remarks. I would like to make just two or three more points, Mr. President. I think that what the Senator from Nebraska is doing, the concept that he is laying out is absolutely sound. I think it is responsible, and I think that it is something we have to do prior to the vote on a balanced budget amendment. There may be a lot of different thought in this Chamber as to what the outcome of this debate might or might not be. Second, I think we need to know some more basic things about a balanced budget amendment. I think we need to know how we are going to achieve a balanced budget, and if some Senators say, ‘‘Oh, we have 7 or 8 years to figure that out; we’ll just vote the balanced budget amendment in and we will feel good; we will write a press release; we will go back home and we will boast that we have voted for a balanced budget amendment,’’ that does not take a lot of creativity, nor a lot of courage. I think what we have to ask ourselves is this: How are we going to achieve a balanced budget if we adopt the balanced budget amendment? What will be the implementing legislation that will be called for? What is going to be the issue with regard to rescission? What is going to be the answer with regard to impoundment? Are we going to basically exclude or include Social Security? Are we going to exclude or include veterans benefits? These are the types of issues, Mr. President, that I think we need to know before we stake out the course of this afternoon, saying it is a congressional decision, that it is essential for VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S551 January 6, 1995 Congress to adopt a balanced budget amendment. The Senator from Pennsylvania stated there is no disagreement among anyone, I think, in this Chamber of whether we need a balanced budget. That is different from a balanced budget amendment, I say respectfully, and I certainly agree with my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania. But we have a lot of things going on here. We have the Contract With America. Some of it has already started to roll. Things are happening very quickly. We are going to have a markup on Monday, I believe, in the Governmental Affairs Committee, on an issue that may or may not change the relationship between the Federal and State governments. That is a voluminous piece of legislation. It is a piece of legislation that I will probably vote for. But, Mr. President, I do not think we are taking enough time to really look and analyze some of these far-reaching pieces of legislation before we cast our vote. But a constitutional amendment to the Federal Constitution to require a balanced budget I think should be voted on when we have the facts, when we know how we are going to achieve and how we will implement that balanced budget that all of us may ultimately support. Mr. President, those are the comments that I have. I see other Senators may be coming to the floor desiring to speak. So with that I will yield the floor, and I will suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have the floor. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that I may, as the Senator who has the floor, propound a question to the Senator from Nebraska without losing my right to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. My question is this, may I say to the distinguished Senator: Would the Senator be willing to revise his proposal in a way that would delete the language that is set forth in paragraph (1) and in (a), preceding (1), which reads as follows: PURPOSE.—The Congress declares it essential that the Congress— (1) adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced Federal budget. Mr. President, before he responds, there are some other aspects of this proposal that the distinguished Senator has made here that I like. I think he is not willing to go into this thing with his eyes shut. He is not willing just to go along with having a constitutional amendment on a balanced budget, although I believe I heard him say he was going to vote for one. I hope he will, in his characteristic fashion, think that through. I have always thought of him as a man who really thinks matters through, and the fact that he has offered this as a proposal today indicates to me that he is thinking that through and that he sees some problems with it. I like most of what the Senator has, but I do not like and could never support (a) and (1): The Congress declares it essential that the Congress adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced Federal budget. I am not for that. I will not be for it tomorrow, and I am going to do everything I can to oppose that for reasons that I will explain later. Now, would the Senator consider revising his proposal so as to leave out that language to which I object strenuously? Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in response to my friend and colleague from West Virginia, I hear his sound and wise advice very clearly. You are not the only Senator that has raised that question, but you are the first one. I will certainly say I have a right to revise the amendment. I have it under consideration to revise it at this time. As I take it, if I would revise the amendment and any amendment anyone ever writes, we could say afterwards, ‘‘Had I had it to do over again, I would have struck this way.’’ If I could anticipate the support of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I take it that he would simply say that we would strike lines 7, 8, and 9, and strike ‘‘(2)’’ in line 10 and make that ‘‘(1)’’; likewise, on line 3, on the second page, strike ‘‘1’’ and make it ‘‘2,’’ that the Senator would feel, with those changes, he would be in a position to support the amendment? Mr. BYRD. The Senator is getting very close. He is getting very close. I do not want to say right here that I would support that as the Senator has outlined the precise changes, but he is moving in the direction, and I would like to see what he puts in as (a). I would like to see what goes in in lieu of what is being taken out. Mr. EXON. May I ask the Senator from Arkansas, who has also spoken to me privately about this general subject, if he agrees with the discussion that just took place between the Senator from West Virginia and this Senator. I would certainly say that I am one of those who for a long time has supported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and I intend to support one when it is finally presented in some form, if that form does not raise too many barriers. If I am presented with a constitutional amendment that says but you cannot touch this and you cannot touch that, I may be in a position of having to say that that kind of a constitutional amendment is unworkable and under those circumstances I could not support it. But I want to make it clear that this Senator supports a constitutional amendment to balance the budget but not just any one. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, do I still have the floor? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from West Virginia has the floor. Mr. BYRD. Before the distinguished Senator from Nebraska inquires of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas with reference to this matter, may I also ask the Senator how he would feel about this proposed language, if the Senator from Arkansas will also indulge me. I would ask the Senator from Nebraska, does he see anything inherently objectionable in the following changes that I would propose: (a) Purpose. The Congress declares that prior to any vote to adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced Federal budget, it is essential— This is paragraph (2).— That it set forth with specificity in the first session— And I am picking up the Senator’s language thereon. This would not declare that it is essential that the Congress adopt a constitutional amendment on a balanced budget. I do not think that is essential. So I am opposed to that. But if we are going to have that, then the Senator would then be saying with his proposal: The Congress declares that— (1) Prior to any vote to adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget; (2) It is essential that it set forth with specificity in the first session of the 104th Congress the policies that achieving such a balanced Federal budget would require; and (3) Enforce through the congressional budget process the requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget. I do not have any comments on the rest of it at this point. I will have to look carefully at the remainder of the Senator’s proposal. But I think he is working on what seems to me to be a very worthwhile proposal. I have asked the question. Mr. EXON. I am glad to respond to my friend from West Virginia. I will take all that I have under consideration. The Senator makes some good points. There are some others who may not be totally enthusiastic about this. But I do not, again, think that there is any set language or set rules. I just want to make it clear that this Senator has long supported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

I am very much interested in what his views are on all of this. Did the Senator seek to ask me a question or was the Senator seeking the floor in his own right? Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I still have the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor. Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for the purpose of his asking those questions. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Without my losing the right to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas had thought that the Senator from Nebraska was posing a question, and I was rising to answer that question. I would like to answer, if I may, by saying I think the Senator is certainly moving in the right direction. Right now, on Friday afternoon, before we have really geared up the Senate, before we really place our feet and our positions in concrete on whether we support or reject the idea of a constitutional amendment, it is in the spirit of good legislative wisdom and in keeping with the legislative philosophy of the Senator from Nebraska, I am sure, that this change be made, and if that change is made, I will enthusiastically—enthusiastically—support the requirements of specificity that the Senator from Nebraska is addressing in his amendment. Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Arkansas. I will take that under advisement. Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator. Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from West Virginia for yielding. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Illinois. Mr. SIMON. If I may have the atten tion of my colleague from Nebraska and also the attention of my friend from West Virginia, I have no objection to dropping point one because this is coming down the road. I would have objection to the language offered by Senator BYRD. Senator BYRD and I differ on this, and Senator BYRD is obviously trying to put some language in here where we will end up fighting over how we balance the budget rather than first establishing the principle. I think it is important that we first establish the principle. So if my colleague from Nebraska were to accept the Byrd amendment, with all due respect to the Cicero of the Senate, I would have to object, I would have to oppose the Exon amendment. Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for just a brief statement? Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield. Mr. EXON. I was very interested in hearing the Senator—Cicero, or the Senator from Illinois—because I had anticipated exactly what my colleague just said. He probably would not object to what I suggested originally. But when Senator BYRD carried it one step further, I saw him rise. Mr. SIMON. That is correct. Mr. EXON. It is nice, though, that we do have this kind of consideration. Mr. President, to try to bring this matter to a head, I send a revised amendment to the desk which is the revised amendment that I first suggested. It strikes lines 7, 8, and 9 of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois still has the floor. Mr. EXON. I am sorry. Mr. SIMON. If I could just ask one other question on the amendment, because I basically like the thrust of the Senator’s amendment. Suppose that a year from now or 2 years from now or 3 years from now, we come in with a health program for the Nation with an increase in cigarette taxes or some other revenue. This amendment would not cause us to have 60 votes to pass such a package, would it? Mr. EXON. It is neutral on that. I think the Senator knows full well what happened in the House of Representatives the other day. But as of now, it would be considered as it has traditionally been considered, a majority vote. However, I would simply say that if something like that were offered under the budget rules, a point of order could be raised if we do not pay for it. Mr. SIMON. Yes, that is correct. And I agree with that completely. Whatever we do in the way of spending we have to have the revenue for it. I just want to make sure that we are not locking out some other possibility. Mr. EXON. We are not. Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I under stand the leader hopes to speak on this amendment very shortly. I understand that Senator BRADLEY wishes to speak on the amendment shortly and is on his way over. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished leader, Senator DASCHLE, be added as original cosponsor of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO. 6, AS MODIFIED Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk as earlier outlined. It simply strikes lines 7, 8, and 9. On line 10 it strikes the number 2 and inserts the number 1. And on line 3, on the second page, it strikes the number 3 and inserts the number 2. I send that modified amendment to the desk and ask the amendment be so modified. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his amendment. The amendment is so modified. The amendment (No. 6) as modified is as follows: At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following: SEC. .—CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET (a) PURPOSE.—The Congress declares it essential that the Congress— (1) set forth with specificity in the first session of the 104th Congress the policies that achieving such a balanced Federal budget would require; and (2) enforce through the congressional budget process the requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget. (b) POINT OF ORDER AGAINST BUDGET RESOLUTIONS THAT FAIL TO SET FORTH A GLIDE PATH TO A BALANCED BUDGET.—Section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting at the end thereof the following new subsection: ‘‘(j) CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET.—It shall not be in order to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget (or amendment, motion, or conference report thereon) that— ‘‘(A) fails to set forth appropriate levels for all items described in subsection (a)(1) through (7) for all fiscal years through 2002; ‘‘(B) sets forth a level of outlays for fiscal year 2002 or any subsequent fiscal year that exceeds the level of revenues for that fiscal year; or ‘‘(C) relies on the assumption of either— ‘‘(i) reductions in direct spending, or ‘‘(ii) increases in revenues, without includ ing specific reconciliation instructions under section 310 to carry out those assumptions.’’. (c) REQUIREMENT FOR 60 VOTES TO WAIVE OR APPEAL IN THE SENATE.—Section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘301(i),’’ in both places that it appears. (d) SUSPENSION IN THE EVENT OF WAR OR CONGRESSIONALLY-DECLARED LOW GROWTH.— Section 258(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by inserting ‘‘301(j),’’ after ‘‘sections’’.

From all appearances, a balanced budget amendment will pass Congress this year. There appears to be widespread support on both sides of the aisle on that point. But we simply cannot afford to wait until 2001 to start complying with the balanced budget amendment. By doing so, we will be adding a far greater burden to our national debt, which already is above $4 trillion. If we pledge our commitment to continued deficit reduction today, we will still need more than $1 trillion of cuts over the next 7 years to balance the budget by the year 2002. If we delay even 1 year, the national debt will increase by over $150 billion as a result of that delay, and the interest on the debt will be approximately $50 billion greater. Each year that we delay adds another enormous sum to our already-astronomical national debt, and increase the percentage of our budget that must be dedicated to servicing that debt. In the last Congress, we passed a deficit reduction package that will reduce the budget deficit by nearly $500 billion. Given the magnitude of our existing debt, it would be irresponsible and profoundly illogical not to continue striving toward a balanced budget this year, not next year or the year after. To illustrate the point that Senator EXON and I are trying to make, consider the simple situation of a person who has run up huge amounts of debt at the bank. Does the bank say to that person, ‘‘You have 7 years to pay off your debt and, by the way, feel free to incur more debt in the meantime?’’ Certainly not. The bank would insist that, at a minimum, the debtor not incur further debt. That is precisely what we are talking about here, and that is why every Member of this body who supports the balanced budget amendment should support this amendment today. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not sure that everybody is aware of what we are considering as the underlying bill in this body. But remember, during the campaign there was a hue and cry from the grassroots, expressed very clearly in that election, that people wanted to end the situation where we had two sets of laws in America, one for Capitol Hill and one for the rest of the Nation. In other words, Congress did not have certain employment safety laws apply to us that applied to the private sector. The small business people of America are very up in arms about the fact that they have to abide by very egregious legislation, and we who make the laws have exempted ourselves from that. That bill passed the House of Representatives 2 days ago unanimously. Senator DOLE placed the Congressional Accountability Act, which I and Sen ator LIEBERMAN are main sponsors of, as a first bill on the agenda because he wanted to respond to the people at the grassroots who expressed in that election the resentment of a dual system of law in America. So that is why that bill is before us. We had debate on that bill yesterday. Senator GLENN, the Democratic manager, spoke very eloquently of the reasons that legislation ought to pass. Senator LIEBERMAN did, several other Democrats and several Republicans did. There does not seem to be much disagreement about what the people said in that election and that S. 2 ought to pass the Senate like it has already passed the House. Yet, we are not getting from there to here very quickly because we are dealing with a lot of amendments that are unrelated to the bill that the people so clearly expressed in the election that we ought to pass and do it very quickly. By the way, one of the things that the new majority wants to do is show the people of this country that it is not business as usual anymore in Washington on Capitol Hill passing legislation that they clearly stated they wanted passed and that is on the agenda of the victor of that election, and we ought to get to it and get the job done. The other body stated that they understood that very well with their action 2 days ago. Hopefully, we will get that done in this body very quickly. But we have dealt with lobbying reform. We have dealt with campaign finance reform. We are going to deal with the issue of private use of frequent flyer mileage. We are now dealing with a very important issue of balancing the budget. There is not one of these issues that is being presented by our friends on the other side of the aisle that are not very legitimate issues to be discussed here. But every one of these issues will be discussed pursuant to the promise of our distinguished leader, Senator DOLE, who said that within just a few weeks we will have lobbying reform and campaign finance reform before this body. It is already on the majority agenda in both the House and Senate that we are going to take up a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. In just 6 weeks we will be working on the budget resolution that fits right into what my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, is trying to accomplish this time on this very important underlying piece of legislation. So I wish that we could get some sort of understanding that we could deal with what the people want us to deal with. The purpose of S. 2 is responding to the mandate of the people in the last election that we should end the dual system of law within this country, one set of law for Congress, and another set of law for the rest of the Nation. But all of this other discussion that is going on is preventing us from getting at what we promised the people in the last election. I do not have a fight with the Senator from Nebraska. He has very worthwhile goals on budget issues. In fact, if you remember in the last Congress, the only successful effort to change President Clinton’s budget was the EXON-GRASSLEY amendment that was adopted that cut $26 billion from the President’s budget when it passed the Senate and $13 billion from the compromise version that came out of the conference committee. So I have worked very closely with Senator EXON in trying to bring a sound fiscal policy to our Federal Government. I will continue to work with him for a sound fiscal policy. Why do it on legislation that is so easily understood by the American people that they very clearly want? And we are almost set to give it to them. The President is prepared to sign it. And I just think we ought to get on with the show and final passage of this legislation and forget about all of this extraneous stuff that is not unimportant. It is a very important issue to be discussing. But there is a time and place for everything, and the time and place is set for all these other issues within just the next few weeks. We are taking up what ought to be No. 1 on everybody’s mind. We have it up. We ought to pass it. I yield the floor. Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from New Jersey. Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the debate of the Senate on a Friday always has a certain unique quality to it. I rise today simply to say to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska that I do not know how this issue will be resolved. I assume it will be resolved today. But I applaud him for raising the issue and the amendment that he has offered. This is really a precursor to a debate we will have here in the next week on the balanced budget amendment. It is really a truth-in-advertising amendment. It makes explicit what anyone who supports a balanced budget amendment should know—which is if you vote for it you have to deliver on it. And it makes explicit what delivering on it, voting for the balanced budget amendment, will cost. I really do not think that there has been adequate public focus on what the cost of a balanced budget amendment will be for average people in this country, for regions of the country which get a disproportionate share of the Federal dollar or elements of the economy that have heavy subsidies. I think that the public needs to see what will be cut if we have to meet a balanced budget by the year 2002. And I am all for that. In the last Congress I was on this floor offering spending cut after spending cut on virtually every appropriations bill. I am pleased that within the Democrats I was No. 4 in voting for spending cuts. I am making the point VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES554 January 6, 1995 only because after you vote for a balanced budget amendment, you then have to vote to cut spending. The balanced budget amendment is just a process. What the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska, as I understand it, does is say that after a balanced budget amendment passes, if it should pass, that any budget resolution has a point of order against it if the budget resolution did not submit a budget that reached a balanced budget by the year 2002, which by the way it is projected will be the year in which the deficit is $322 billion. So anyone who supports the balanced budget amendment would have to support this Exon proposal, because that would make explicit how we cut $322 billion by the year 2002. I applaud the Senator very much for his amendment. I know that we will yet have a chance to debate the balanced budget amendment. One of the puzzling things for me with regard to understanding the support for the balanced budget amendment—and maybe the Senator from Nebraska is aware of this—is that there are certain States in the Union that get a higher return on their tax dollar than other States. Certain States pay taxes, and get back a lot more in Federal spending than they have sent to Washington in taxes. Unfortunately, my State is not in that group because we have a high income. We pay a high tax, and we send a lot of tax dollars to Washington. We do not get back that many tax dollars relative to what we sent. Once we get a balanced budget amendment, all those States which get back much more than they kick in— and these States are disproportionately in the West—those are the States that will be disproportionately hit by the need to dramatically cut spending $322 billion by the year 2002. And in the coming debate, I hope that we will be able to focus on these facts. I think the Senator’s amendment is an enormously positive step in getting us to face up to what actually balancing the budget will mean. It will not be easy. There will be no substitute for cutting spending, and there will be no substitute for Senators coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate and voting to cut spending, not voting for a process in that 7 or 10 years from now if it goes into effect, and if there are no exclusions or if there are loopholes, will lead to a balanced budget. We need to have Senators actually coming over here and voting to cut spending. So I applaud the Senator from Nebraska for his amendment. I know that perhaps he and I have a different view on the balanced budget amendment, but his amendment makes explicit what steps must be taken if we are to balance the budget and requires the Congress to belly up to the wire and say in 7 years we are going to balance the budget, and here is how we are going to do it—not that in 7 years we will create some budget glidepath down to a balanced budget in 10 years or 15 years from now, but in 2002. So I am anxiously awaiting such a congressional resolution, because I think once that congressional resolution is out there and you see how much is going to have to be cut in virtually every subsidy, virtually every Federal program, virtually every entitlement there for the last 14 years in the Federal Government, there will be a moment of truth for the Congress and a moment of truth for those who have voted for the balanced budget amendment. I salute the Senator for his amendment. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from the State of New Jersey very much for his excellent remarks. I think he has indeed hit it right on the head. This is a truth-in-advertising amendment, in addition to a truth-in-budgeting amendment. And the Senator made an excellent, right- on point as to what this is all about. I hope, therefore, we will have the votes to pass this. We first have to get the 60 votes to waive. I also thank my friend and colleague from Iowa. Senator GRASSLEY and myself have worked together on many things over the years, and we will be working on things in the future. I simply say to my friend from Iowa that I was very pleased with the fact that he mentioned once again what few know— that the only reductions made in the budget last year were the Exon-Grassley amendments that he and I fashioned and worked through the Congress. What I am doing in this particular case, as the Senator has clearly indicated, is to apply to Congress what we apply to others—And if Congress wants to have a balanced budget amendment, which I hope they do, then they should live up to it. You had indicated in your remarks that while you thought the Exon amendment was probably a good one, this is the wrong place to put it. Well, I suggest that this is the right place to put it. What we are talking about here today is to make Congress live up to the laws that it applies to the people of the United States. If we are going to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, then that has to apply to the Congress. So I think it is very appropriate that this measure be passed on the bill, the underlying bill before us, which I indicated in my opening remarks I strongly support. Now, it is not the intention of this Senator to delay at all the institution of the measure that is going to receive overwhelming support. Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield—— Mr. EXON. I am prepared to come to a vote in a relatively short period of time. I do not want to be accused of holding up anything. I think it is important enough that it should go on this legislation. I do not think there is any piece of legislation we are likely to pass this year that is going to be more important than a con stitutional amendment to balance the budget, which 80 percent of the people in the United States of America want. I want to get on with that. I do not happen to buy the reason or excuse, depending on your point of view, as to why it should not be an amendment to the measure before us. Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question. Mr. EXON. Yes, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question. Mr. DORGAN. I have listened to some of the debate on this issue, and I have heard some say, Gee, I do not necessarily oppose what you are trying to do, but maybe this is not the place or time to do it. That is always an interesting discussion. I understand that one can make a stronger or weaker case against doing something like this on one bill or another. But the fact is that the ultimate—it seems to me that the ultimate rule and the ultimate circumstance, which is that we ought to live the way everybody else does in this country, would be to have a budget process that says when you come here with a budget, let us, if we are going to pass a constitutional amendment—and I think we will—to balance the budget, and let us require the budget document itself to get us to that point. In other words, if you bring a road map to the floor of the Senate that is purported to be the budget but never gets to the destination, of what value is the map? And the Senator from Nebraska, who I think has been one of the most consistent voices on this subject over the years, I think, does a service by raising the question. I assume if the Senator from Nebraska loses the vote here because some people say, Gee, this is a great idea but the wrong place, I assume we will see it again. I hope we see it again. I fully intend to vote for it, because I do not think this is a question of what place you put this in the process. The question is whether this makes sense in the context of what we are about to embark on this year as a body. The answer clearly is yes. It makes perfect sense, and it makes perfect sense to do now, this minute. I wanted to state that the Senator has done a service, I think, by offering this. I hope my colleagues will look at the merits of this and say: Gee, this makes a lot of sense. If we are going to put out a budget map here, let us have a destination on the map that gets us to what all the American people want— that is, a balanced budget. I will frame it in a question. As I have understood the debate, is it the understanding of the Senator from Nebraska that there seems to be a fair amount, at least, of sympathy with this amendment, but some are saying, Gee maybe we cannot vote for it because it is the wrong time? Will the Senator once again explain, is there a better time anywhere he knows of than to pass this at this moment?

Mr. EXON. In answer to my friend from North Dakota, I do not know of a better time or a more appropriate time, as I have said. Since we are talking about making laws that we apply to others apply to ourselves, what more important law is there than a constitutional amendment? I simply say that I thank my friend from North Dakota for his kind remarks. I must say to him that this Senator was somewhat surprised to find opposition to this amendment, because I felt that this amendment would pass overwhelmingly since we had almost two-thirds of the Senate vote for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget last year. Then I heard about the fact that there may be a point of order raised against the amendment, since it was not particularly germane, as the rules of the Senate so indicate, so therefore I moved to waive that. We have to have 60 votes now to even have an up-or-down vote on the Exon amendment. I was quite surprised because I thought the opposition to the Exon amendment would come from the relatively few Members of the U.S. Senate that traditionally have stood against passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. And there are some legitimate reasons that those people have, and very well thought of Members of this Senate. I do not suppose there is a better constitutional lawyer in this body than Senator BYRD of West Virginia. He is fundamentally opposed to a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. He has pointed out in several speeches that I have heard him give that, while it is true that you have this in some of the States, it does not and should not apply in the Congress of the United States. To answer the Senator’s question, I am somewhat mystified at the opposition that has arisen to this, since I thought two-thirds of the people were for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I am, therefore, very concerned about the fact, I must tell my friend from North Dakota, that possibly some of our colleagues are for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget but do not want to spell out the hard choices that are going to have to be made. So I will simply say, in answer to another question that the Senator from North Dakota raised, if the Exon amendment is defeated in any fashion on this particular measure, I assure my friend from North Dakota that it will, in the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, come up again and again and again. So there will be chances for people to vote on this again if it fails today. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator from Nebraska to yield one more moment, just for one additional question. Mr. EXON. Yes. Mr. DORGAN. The prospect here of voting today and deciding not to sup port this, as the Senator has said, will produce this same amendment in the future. I am pleased to hear him say that. I think all of us probably agree that a balanced budget—that is, a zero balance—is not necessarily nirvana somewhere out there. I did not used to think we should change the Constitution to do this, as a matter of fact. But year after year after year of a budget that is fundamentally out of balance with respect to operating budget deficits, that cannot continue. That hurts this country. And I decided some years ago, gee, I mean, we do not have much choice. But we could change the Constitution at 2:15, 3 minutes from now, and it will do nothing, nothing, to balance the budget. We will simply have changed the Constitution to require a balanced budget, and then others will have to find ways to achieve those ends. I must also say to you that I would not care at all if we had a budget deficit that was $300 billion this year if that budget deficit, by its expenditure, had cured cancer, as an example. Spend $300 billion you do not have and cure cancer. Is that a good investment? Your darn right it is a good investment. It would not bother me a bit. But the billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, that we are now spending that we do not have are not investments. They are operating budget deficits, year after year, that cannot continue. If this were an investment, it would be one thing. But it is not an investment, it is the operating budget. And it is, in my judgment, impeding this country’s economy and opportunity. So that is why I support what the Senator is doing. I hope, Mr. President, the Senator will prevail today. If not, I hope the Senator will tell us how soon he will be back to give us the opportunity to do this once again. Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from North Dakota. Let me say, in probably closing debate, since I am ready to vote on this at the pleasure of the majority leader, the Senator is certainly right. The balanced budget amendment does not in and of itself balance a budget. And that needs to be said time and time again. We will need, sooner or later, an amendment just like mine if we are ever going to balance the budget. When the Senator was talking about—and I thought he made an excellent point—if we had a $200 or $300 billion deficit and we had cured cancer as a result of it, I think we would all vote for it. But the deficit has become a way of life, unfortunately. Not only is the budget deficit something that we talk about—and I think we should have possibly a better understanding by the American people of this addition to the problem of the annual deficits in the billions of dollars; that is only part of the problem. The real problem is, at the end of each and every fiscal year, we take whatever the deficit is and we get rid of it. It goes away. Where does it go? On the national debt. I find many times that many people simply have not taken the time to address the fact that they hear about billions and billions of dollars, between a $100 billion and a $350 billion deficit, and that is only for 1 year. All of that, of course, goes on to the national debt at the end of every fiscal year. So we not only have the annual deficit to worry about, we have the absolutely skyrocketing national debt of the United States that, of course, is the accumulation of all the deficits over the years. At the present time, that national debt stands at $4.7 trillion. Interest alone on the national debt that, once again, is the accumulation of the annual fiscal year deficits, is the fastest growing part of the debt—not welfare, not food stamps, not even national defense. The fastest growing part of the drain on your tax dollars is interest on the national debt. I thought the President explained it pretty well recently in a speech when he said that very shortly, when you pay your income taxes in April 1995, 28 cents—28 cents—of every dollar that is paid in taxes by the American people next April 15 goes directly to pay interest on the national debt which, of course, is the accumulation of the annual deficits. I wonder how many Americans fully understand that. Not only is that a serious problem, but I say to you that as far as we can see into the future—and even the projections into the future by the year 2002, where we are going to have annual deficits in the $200 billion to $350 billion range annually—that national debt that is already at $4.7 trillion is clearly going to go up at the rate of $200 to $300 to $350 billion a year, if and when we pass the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and if and when we ever line up how we are going to reach that by the 2002 date. Another way of saying that is under the best scenario, the most optimistic scenario, we are going to see the national debt go from $4.7 to $6 or $7 trillion while we are twiddling our thumbs here and debating whether or not an amendment to put teeth in the balanced budget amendment is germane on a bill before the U.S. Senate. It does not make any sense to me. I do not think it will make any sense to the American people when they understand it. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, I yield the Senator from North Dakota whatever time he desires. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I have come to the floor to commend the Senator for what I think is an excellent amendment, precisely the kind of amendment we ought to consider and we ought to support today. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska has offered an amendment which says simply and clearly and powerfully, that if we are going to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, something that I support, that we ought to match our words and our deeds. That is precisely what the Senator from Nebraska has put before this body. Mr. President, that is what the underlying legislation is all about. Matching words with deeds. Holding Congress accountable. Having Congress follow the laws that it writes. Nothing could be more important with respect to a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution than that we actually start to write a balanced budget. Not just pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and then do the same old thing and not start to actually balance the budget. The easiest thing in the world is to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and then do nothing to start balancing the budget. I cannot think of anything that would be more destructive of public trust than to engage in that kind of cruel public hoax. That is precisely what could happen here. We all know what is politically easy and what is politically hard. What is politically easy is to stand up and say ‘‘I’m for a balanced budget;’’ what is politically hard is to actually do the work of balancing the budget. That is what is challenging. That is what is difficult. That is what is politically hard to do. The Senator from Nebraska says ‘‘Yes, let’s have a balanced budget amendment; but beyond that, let’s ac tually start to balance the budget.’’ What a novel idea. Mr. President, it is precisely what we ought to do. That is exactly what we ought to do. I cannot think of anything that would give this country more confidence in what we are doing than that. Now, Mr. President, one of the things I am concerned about as I watch this debate is we talk about balancing the budget, but we rarely talk about why we should balance the budget. It is not just because it makes us feel good. It is not just because you should match what you spend with what you take in. It is because balancing the budget has real economic consequences that are positive for this country. It makes a difference in the lives of people. Mr. President, we got the evidence today of a package we passed 2 years ago doing something positive in the lives of people. Just today we received news of what has happened with the unemployment rate in this country. It has dropped to 5.4 percent, the lowest level in 4 years, and 3.5 million jobs were created in this country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The remaining 3 minutes belongs to the Senator from Iowa. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we might extend the time by 10 minutes, to be equally divided. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield whatever time is remaining to me to my colleague from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska. As I was pointing out, 3.5 million jobs were created in 1994—3.5 million. I believe one of the key reasons is that a number of us had the courage to vote for a budget package 2 years ago that reduced the deficit by over $500 billion over the next 5 years. Because we did that, because we cut spending, and, yes, raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent among us, the result was a reduced deficit. The result of that was reduced interest rates. The result of that was renewed economic growth in this country, increased job creation, and a much stronger economy. That is why we need to move toward a balanced budget, because it will take pressure off of interest rates. It will allow this economy to continue to grow. It will allow this country to get back on track. That is why the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska is so important. Mr. President, I thank, again, the Senator from Nebraska. I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and one-half minutes for the Senator from Iowa and 1 minute and 14 seconds for the Senator from Nebraska Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time on this side. Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, insert the following: SEC. . SENSE OF THE SENATE. (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— (1) Bridgestone/Firestone, a subsidiary of foreign owned Bridgestone Corp., has recently announced its decision to hire permanent replacement workers displacing more than 2,000 American workers; (2) this action may result in the largest permanent displacement of workers in over a decade: (3) the practice of hiring permanent replacement workers is devastating, not only to the replaced workers, but also to their families and communities; (4) the position of management of foreign owned Bridgestone/Firestone appears to be that they cannot compete with their American owned competitor, Goodyear, if they provide wages, benefits, and conditions of employment benefits patterned after those provided by Goodyear; (5) hiring permanent replacement workers is illegal under the laws of the parent company’s own country; and (6) most of the United States’ major trading partners, including Japan, Germany, France, and Canada, recognize that using permanent replacements is bad business and bad public policy. (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense of the Senate that— (1) Bridgestone/Firestone should reconsider its decision to hire permanent replacement workers and return to the bargaining table and bargain in good faith with the United Rubberworkers of America, the representative of their employees; and (2) the Clinton Administration, working through the appropriate diplomatic channels and using the appropriate trade negotiations, should impress upon the parent company’s home government the concern of the United States over this matter and seek their assistance in getting Bridgestone/Firestone to reconsider their decision. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator GLENN, Senator HARKIN, Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN, Senator FEINGOLD, and myself. And I believe I am willing to enter into a time agreement on that. I am checking with Senator DASCHLE on my side on the time agreement and I should know that very shortly. Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield. Mr. BYRD. Before we will be able to enter into a time agreement, some of us would like to know what the amendment does. We did not let the clerk read it. Mr. SIMON. I did not let the clerk read it but I will be happy to explain the amendment. Mr. BYRD. May I hear that before we are asked to enter into an agreement? Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding a strike situation that we face in this country. Bridgestone/Firestone is a company wholly owned by a Japanese corporation. They bought Firestone, merged the two companies. They have had a strike on since July. And back, I guess about a month ago, Senator GLENN and Senator HARKIN and Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN and several of us met with the Japanese Ambassador and urged that they negotiate, that they sit down and negotiate. I, frankly, do not know, in terms of the dispute between labor and management, which side is right. What I do know is that they ought to sit down and negotiate. But the Bridgestone/ Firestone has announced they are going to fire all the strikers and permanently replace them. That is—I have been doing some checking—we have had only two precedents like that since the 1930’s. We have had no striker replacement law, as Western Europe and Canada and the other countries do, but we have had a tradition that you do not do that. And this resolution simply says to the corporation: Sit down and negotiate, rather than just firing several thousand workers. I would hope that we could adopt this resolution. My friend from Iowa indicates that he has some concerns, otherwise we could adopt it by voice vote. That is basically the situation. Let me point out one other thing. This is a Japanese—wholly-owned Japanese firm now. In Japan it would be illegal for them to do what they are doing in Illinois, in Iowa, in Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana. My hope is that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution could be adopted and that we can move forward. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment of my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, [Mr. SIMON], and to give some background on this issue. It is something that has troubled us greatly and that I believe is a matter that really boils down to good corporate citizenship. Mr. President, some 4,000 members of the United Rubber Workers, including 1,250 members of local 713 in Decatur, IL, have been exercising their right to strike against the Bridgestone/Firestone company which is, as Senator SIMON indicated, a foreign-owned corporation. The strike began when, after months of negotiations, the company refused to accept a contract that was similar to the contract the United Rubber Workers had negotiated with Goodyear, which is an American company. Throughout the duration of the strike the United Rubber Workers have maintained a willingness to bargain with Bridgestone/Firestone to attempt to resolve their differences. In fact, earlier this week the URW bargaining committee notified Bridgestone/Firestone that it would be meeting with Federal mediators in an effort to resume bargaining and to end the work stoppage. Unfortunately, the company has not shown the same willingness to negotiate in good faith. In fact, some 2 days ago the company informed its workers that they will be permanently replaced as a result of this ongoing dispute. A number of Senators and I, whose workers are affected by this strike, have done everything we can, everything possible, to try to help resolve this dispute. In fact, just this afternoon I called on and had a conversation with some of our trade negotiators, to see to it that these kinds of issues of the conduct, the corporate citizenship of foreign companies doing business here in America, was an issue that would be brought up in their trade discussions and negotiations in future times. We will see how that plays out. But the point is, without giving a long speech about this because I understand there are others who want to speak to this issue, this company is doing to American workers what American companies cannot do, or have not done, to American workers, by and large. Senator SIMON has discovered one tiny precedent of similarity in one instance. But by and large, in this industry, what is going on here is quite extraordinary. While on the one hand we do not want to get in a situation in which investment by foreign companies is discouraged—we want to encourage investment, we want to encourage participation—we certainly want to encourage positive relations with our VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES558 January 6, 1995 companies from whatever part of the world they may come, the fact is that when one is doing business here in the United States it is only appropriate and only a function of good corporate citizenship that one does business in keeping with the values and the tradition and the fair play that American workers, I think, have every right to expect. We do not have a striker replacement law in this country but we know for a fact it is against the law to fire a worker for exercising the right to strike. It is not against the law to permanently replace that worker. But at the same time, to have permanent replacement resorted to as a measure by corporate leadership in an instance in which it would not happen if it were an American company, or has not happened in certain similarly situated American companies, sours the atmosphere and sets an unfortunate precedent that I hope the leadership of Bridgestone/ Firestone would take a good hard look at and reconsider. Mr. President, with that I encourage my colleagues to support this sense-of- the-Senate resolution and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to support the actions being taken by Senator SIMON. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Certainly we would not be willing to vote today to do exactly the opposite and to say no, we do not think there should be any more negotiations; no, we think it should be final. Even Japanese law, it was pointed out here, in the home country of Japan—this is a wholly-owned Japanese corporation now—but the law in Japan would prevent them from doing exactly what we are doing here, even though we have yet to put into place any striker replacement legislation in this country. So surely we do not go the opposite tack and say, ‘‘No. We don’t think there should be any more negotiation.’’ We do quite the opposite. We say, ‘‘Look, it is never too late.’’ And while we cannot take sides in this as U.S. Senators and come down on exactly what the final solution would be, surely it is within our responsibility to our people in our respective States and this country to say, ‘‘Look, don’t just give up on this thing. At least sit down and talk about it some more.’’ I know it has been a long discussion. They have had long negotiations. But sometimes just when things look the blackest in the negotiation is when real progress can be made. I hope this is not just a negotiating ploy. I do not think it is. I think Bridgestone/Firestone is serious about this, and that makes it all the more incumbent upon us to take some action here on the Senate floor. So I had real hope after we met with the Japanese Ambassador that he was going to use his good offices to do everything he possibly could. Perhaps he did. I certainly will not say that he did not do everything that he could possibly do. But what we are saying is, in the interest of fairness to our workers and in the interest of even the company adhering to what the Japanese law is, sit down again and let us see if we cannot work this thing out before we go through the throes of seeing some 2,000-plus American workers being tossed out permanently. I think that would be too bad. I want to compliment Senator SIMON for taking the lead on this and am glad to support his sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KYL). The Senator from Illinois. Mr. SIMON. I thank Senator GLENN. Mr. President, let me just add one other point. In addition to the labor- management factor here, I think the other factor is United States-Japan relations. This is not the kind of thing that is going to help relations between our two countries. So I hope that, if we adopt this resolution—and I hope we do—that the corporation would take another look at this. This is not good for United States-Japan relations as well as not good for the future of this corporation, Bridgestone/Firestone. The rubber workers have taken the position they should have the same contract as they do with the Firestone competitor, Goodyear. I do not know whether they are right or wrong. That is not the point. All we say is sit down and negotiate and see if this can be worked out. Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I question the presence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time prior to a motion to table the Simon amendment be as follows: 5 minutes under the control of myself, 20 minutes under the control of Senator SIMON; and, further, at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to table the Simon amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time? Mr. SIMON. I say to my colleague from Iowa, if he is going to yield his time, I am willing to yield my time and proceed to a vote. Mr. GRASSLEY. Except for Senator KASSEBAUM to speak a few moments, as she put it, we will do that. Mr. SIMON. I always welcome Senator KASSEBAUM’s speech. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as she might consume to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, NANCY KASSEBAUM. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. KASSEBAUM], is recognized. Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Illinois as well. As he knows, I have some strong views on this issue that I would like to express. I can certainly appreciate the points of view of the Senators from Illinois, Senators MOSELEY-BRAUN and SIMON. But I have to rise in strong opposition to the resolution that has been offered by the Senator from Illinois. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the resolution offered by the Senator from Illinois. The Senator’s resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that Bridgestone/Firestone Tire Co. should not use permanent replacements for workers on strike in a labor dispute in Ohio, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Illinois. Mr. President, we have been through this argument on the floor, and it is well understood by most everyone here. The Congressional Accountability Act passed the House of Representatives on a unanimous vote 2 days ago, and now we are here on a late Friday afternoon with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on an enormously important issue that does not relate in any way to the Congressional Accountability Act. I know the Senator from Illinois is well-intentioned. But this is neither the time nor the place for Congress to be considering anything other than this very important bill which is before us—the Congressional Accountability Act. The amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois is completely extraneous from the matter at hand, and for that reason alone I believe the Senate should table his amendment. Not only is the amendment inappropriate and untimely, but it is also wrong on the substance as well. Just for a moment, if I may reiterate what we have talked about before in the debate on this issue, Congress should not take sides in a private labor dispute as this amendment clearly does. We should not take sides in a private dispute. Because we have many new Members in this body, I think it might be helpful to provide a brief background on our Federal labor laws. It has been established Federal labor law for over 50 years that labor has the right to strike, and companies have the right to continue operating during the strike. On rare occasions, this may require hiring permanent replacements. These competing rights, and the risks they entail, enable the parties to settle the overwhelming number of labor disputes at the bargaining table which is the way I believe strongly they should be resolved.

It really disrupts completely. I would argue that the balance is a difficult one, but I think a fair balance. The compelling nature of these arguments led the Senate to defeat legislation—S. 55—during both the 102d and 103d Congress. S. 55 would have prohibited employers from hiring permanent replacements during an economic strike. So the law is clear the employers may hire permanent replacements during economic strikes. Mr. President, Congress established the private collective bargaining system to facilitate the peaceful resolution of labor disputes. We leave it to the parties to decide for themselves what a fair deal is. As difficult as it may be—and each of us has had these disputes in our own States and we wish we could do something that could bring it to a resolution, but as sure as we start down that path, we will all regret it and all the parties to those labor disputes will regret it as well. It is not for this body to decide whether Bridgestone is justified in hiring permanent replacements during the course of their current labor dispute. We are not the arbiters of labor disputes in the U.S. Senate, and we do not judge the fairness of any of the terms of a particular labor agreement. Mr. President, it is improper for the Senate to single out one company and attempt to influence a private labor dispute. Regardless of the merits on either side, we do not negotiate collective bargaining agreements in the Senate. There is a good reason for this. We would be establishing a dangerous precedent if we approved this sense-of- the-Senate resolution, because we would be opening ourselves up to debating the merits of very single labor disputes. In fact, we would see a virtual parade of labor and management groups coming to Capitol Hill seeking to gain a bargaining advantage through congressional action. We do not want to start that kind of precedent. Mr. President, I am also perplexed by the language in the resolution that compares the laws of the United States and Japan. The resolution seems to suggest that there is something wrong with Bridgestone, a Japanese-owned company, following the laws of the United States, because using permanent replacements would be illegal in Japan. Companies doing business in the United States are supposed to follow our laws. We demand that they follow our laws, whether they are owned by the Japanese or by Americans. So the fact that Japanese law does not allow permanent replacements is totally irrelevant. The irony, of course, is that often we complain that American companies export jobs overseas. In this case, a Japanese company bought an American company—Firestone—and invested billions of dollars in an American company to make it financially viable. I think we want to encourage that kind of investment. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me say in response to my colleague from Kansas, that we are not passing the law on striker replacement. This is simply a sense of the Senate stating they ought to sit down and work these things out. We do have traditions of not hiring permanent replacements for strikers. And as far as interfering in a labor-management situation, we have passed a lot of resolutions on these, including specific legislation. This is not legislation. We have, on at least three occasions that I know of, passed legislation dictating what is going to happen in railroad strikes, since I have been in the Senate. And since my colleague from Kansas has been here longer, she has probably voted for more than three of these. This is only a sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging the two parties to sit down and work things out. We do not take sides. We do not say one side is right and one side is wrong. We do say that firing these thousands of workers who are on strike is not the direction we think they should go. I have participated in the striker replacement legislation, and I think everyone here on the floor said we do not think this is the way people should go, even though that ultimate right should be there for employers. Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. SIMON. I yield, of course, to my colleague from Illinois. Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not a fact that the parties are refusing to negotiate or even discuss the contractual issues at this time? Mr. SIMON. That is correct. Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also a fact that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which is not now legislation, simply calls on the company to discuss the issues with its workers? Mr. SIMON. And to negotiate, that is correct. Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also a fact that the American company with which this company is the competition has already reached closure on the issues that are currently at issue here? Mr. SIMON. That is correct. Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also a fact that you have taken this opportunity on this bill—and I understand the Senator from Kansas is concerned about this coming in the middle of the Congressional Accountability Act, and I think we are all concerned about that and would like to see this legislation resolved. But at the same time, given the enormity of the concern of the company and the workers, is it not a fact that time is of the essence and this was an opportunity to move on this issue in order to facilitate—or at least encourage—that such discussions take place over the weekend? Mr. SIMON. Absolutely. In terms of cluttering up this bill, as the Senator from Kansas indicated, if she will indicate to me that she will be happy to support this legislation if we introduce it independently and not on this bill, I will be happy to withdraw it, and we will bring it up independently. Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may respond. I must say that I am very sensitive to the concerns the Senator has with an industry that is facing some real turmoil in his State and other States. I realize it is a sense-of- the-Senate resolution, and it applies specifically to one private company. When you mention the railroad strikes, just to draw a distinction, that was a strike that affected the whole country and was of national concern. Even then we were sensitive to intrusion by Congress. The reason I went over the striker replacement issue is because you address it in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. In many ways I would say I am sympathetic. But I do not think that we should address it here in the United States Congress. It opens every other private labor-management dispute to our wanting to try to address it from Washington and intruding on what is a private bargaining position. That is my concern. I thank the Senator from Illinois, even though I recognize Senator SIMON’s and Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN’s interest in the issue. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am a great believer in sitting down and working things out. Any time anybody in this body wants to put up a resolution for any corporation where there is a strike resolution, encouraging both sides to sit down, I am willing to support it. I think that is a sensible position for the U.S. Senate to take. Let me add that I am willing to vote soon. I understand Senator HARKIN is on his way over here to speak. I hope we can just give him another minute or two to get over here. I am sure he will speak briefly, because I know some people are anxious to get out of here. I do not want to hold anyone up. If no one else seeks the floor, I will suggest the absence of a quorum for about 3 minutes. If Senator HARKIN is not here, we will move ahead. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The recent developments surrounding this 6-month strike are very unfortunate for all concerned. I am a strong supporter of the collective bargaining process, and although companies have the right to replace strikers during an economic strike, it is a tragic decision for the workers and their families. It is not helpful for our economy, and frankly, for that matter, the company. I am deeply concerned about the workers and their families, and therefore have written a letter to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service urging them to redouble their efforts and find possible alternatives to bring company and union officials together to bring this dispute to a satisfactory conclusion. Others may want to do the same. However, as I have voted against all other amendments to the congressional coverage bill, I will vote against this resolution as well. The congressional coverage bill is not the appropriate vehicle. Mr. SIMON. I am willing to yield back my time and move to a vote. Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back the time on this side. Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen ator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was unable to be on the floor prior to the vote to join my colleague from Illinois on this debate on this resolution. But I did want to take a couple minutes now to add my voice in support of the resolution that Senator SIMON offered. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of it. As Senator SIMON said before the vote, what Bridgestone Corp., a Japanese-owned corporation, is doing with our workers at the Firestone plant in my State of Iowa would be illegal for them to do in their own country. What they want to do with our workers would be illegal in their own country. Mr. President, I am very close to the Firestone plant in Des Moines, IA. Many of my cousins work there. In the small town of 150 that I come from, almost half the town had worked at Firestone at one time or another. Many of my cousins work there. In fact, I spoke to one just yesterday. He has worked there almost 20 years, has a couple of kids in college, and has given the best years of his life to Firestone. Now they are told that they can just go take a walk, that they do not have a contract to operate under, and that they have to accede to what I consider to be unconscionable terms that Bridgestone has put up. I might also point out, Mr. President, and for the benefit of my colleagues here, that the Bridgestone Corp. in Japan also has union employees—Japanese union employees in Japan—and they make tires, just as they do in America. The average annual wage of a Japanese union employee in Japan working for Bridgestone is $52,500 a year. In the United States, their average wage is $37,045 a year. Yet, Bridgestone is telling our people in this country, our workers, that they have to take less money. Is that based on productivity? Hardly. In March of 1994, the workers at the Firestone plant in America reached a new high of 80.5 pounds of rubber tire per man hour and set an all-time record, and they did it with 600 fewer workers. So it is not based on productivity. Bridgestone simply wants to ratchet down the wages of our American workers, even much lower than what they pay their own in Japan. But most unconscionable, I think, is the kind of work schedule they want to put them on. Understand this: The Bridgestone company has said to the Firestone workers: ‘‘We want you to work a 12-hour shift.’’ There would be two 12-hour shifts a day at their plants. But then they would work 3 days on a 12-hour shift, and they would have 2 days off. Then they would work 2 days on a 12-hour shift and have 3 days off. Then they would work 2 days on a 12- hour shift and have 2 days off. Then they would come back around and work 2 days on, 3 days off. You have to have a calculator to calculate when your days off will be. You might be off one Saturday and not off on another Saturday for 3 weeks. Most of these people have spouses who work and kids in school; they could never plan to be home with their families. And yet the Bridgestone employees in Japan do not work those 12-hour days. They work 8-hour shifts; three 8-hour shifts a day. They know exactly what days they are going to have off. But Bridgestone is telling our workers: ‘‘Forget it; you can’t plan any time with your families. You are on this rotating shift of 12 hours a day.’’ And they are going to pay them less money. So I just want to make these points, Mr. President, because I think we ought to send a signal to Bridgestone Corp. that we just cannot allow our workers in this country to be treated in that manner. We have had a long tradition of collective bargaining in this country. With what is happening now with the replacement of these workers, the right of collective bargaining is a hollow right. The right of collective bargaining takes with it the VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S561 January 6, 1995 right to be able to bargain with whatever power and resources you have. The only power and resource that a worker has in this country is to withhold his or her labor. They have no other bargaining power. And so if that power then becomes a hollow power; if, in fact, I do exercise my legal right to go on strike and the company says, ‘‘Fine, you can do that; then, bang, I will replace you,’’ then, A, there is no real right to strike, and because there is no real right to strike and withhold your labor then, B, there is no real right to collective bargaining any longer in this country. I said to the replacement workers that were being hired in Des Moines: ‘‘You may think you have a good job, but without a contract, you may not have a job next year or next week or even tomorrow.’’ In fact, I have already been contacted by one of those replacement workers who was just fired for the most scant reasons. He said: ‘‘I came, I thought I had a good job, and they told me I was fired.’’ So what is happening to our workers in this country and what Bridgestone is doing to our workers, as Senator SIMON pointed out, is illegal in Japan. I say to Bridgestone/Firestone that this issue is far from over. The Japanese Prime Minister is coming to this country next week to meet with our President. I intend to take the opportunity, when he is here, to take this floor to speak about this injustice by a Japanese corporation. Now, I am not blaming the Japanese Prime Minister for this. He may not even know about it. But I want him to know about it. I want him to know what that corporation is doing in this country. I know the Japanese Prime Minister is interested in good relations between Japan and America. I am, too. I do not want to join those who are bashing Japan. They are a good, strong ally and a good friend of ours. I respect them highly, and I like them. I spent a year and a half of my life living in Japan. But this kind of action by this corporation is unconscionable. I believe that the Government of Japan ought to be looking into what this company is doing with their workers in this country. So I intend, as I said, Mr. President to take this floor next week when the Prime Minister of Japan is here to once again talk about this company and what it is doing so that he is not mistaken in any way, so that he takes back with him the strong feelings that this Senator and I believe the people I represent have about the gross injustice being perpetrated on the Firestone workers in this country. Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield? Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield. Mr. SIMON. I wish to commend him for his statement, and I simply want the officers of that corporation to know this vote today was just the first salvo. This is not the end of the road. The Senator is talking about when the Japanese Prime Minister is here. I do not know what other opportunities we are going to have. All I know is what has happened is wrong, wrong, wrong. We have to turn it around in some way. I do not know whether the rubber workers are right in all their requests. I do not know all the things that management has requested. All I know is that the right way to settle this dispute is to sit down and work it out between labor and management, not to hire workers permanently to replace workers of those families the Senator is talking about. So I commend my colleague, and I look forward to working with him. Mr. HARKIN. My colleague is absolutely right. In fact, the Department of Labor has had the Federal Mediation Service working on this case for quite some months. They have been working in good faith to try to resolve these differences. They have been very close. There is not that much separating the two parties. I think if Bridgestone/ Firestone would in good faith sit down and negotiate, they could reach an amicable settlement of the strike. Mr. SIMON. The Senator from Iowa is absolutely correct. It is interesting that the former chief executive of the American operation received awards for his labor-management relations and the improvement of productivity that took place. Now, all of a sudden, with the change in executives, things went downhill fast. We have to do what we can to encourage the two sides to get together. Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague. I have a letter to the editor of the Des Moines Register written by a farmer who was commenting on this strike, what Bridgestone was doing. He said I went out and counted and that he counted his tractors, trucks, wagons, combine, there were over 140 tires. He said that should Bridgestone continue to refuse to negotiate, he would never buy a tire made by them. I would like to ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter to the editor and several others be included in the record at the conclusion of my statement. I think that ought to be a signal to Bridgestone/Firestone. There are other tires out there, and I know this Senator and probably a lot of the workers in this country who drive automobiles are going to look askance at Bridgestone/Firestone if they will not sit down and work this thing out and will feel that maybe there are other tires they can buy and maybe there ought to be a boycott against buying tires from Bridgestone/Firestone if they are going to treat our people in this manner. There being no objection, the letters to the editor were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE REGISTER’S READERS SAY—A TIRE COMPANY’S ‘‘ASSAULT’’ ON UNION The situation at Bridgestone/Firestone has been of great concern to me since the strike began. It is a continuation of the story family farmers and our laboring friends have experienced since 1980 from those who want cheap raw materials and labor to maximize their profits. A quick inventory tells me that my tractor, trucks, wagons, combine and cars roll on more than 140 tires. My vow to Bridgestone/ Firestone is that if this strike is not settled within 30 days, I will never buy another tire made by them—Joe Weisshaar, chairman, Iowa Farm Unity Coalition. There are many ways to do violence. Twelve workers at Bridgestone/Firestone were fired by the company three days before Christmas as a response to what the company referred to as ‘‘acts of violence, threats and aggressive behavior.’’ I do not condone physical violence and physical threats. Most of us abhor such things as they occur in labor confrontations. However, that is what company officials are counting on in this situation as they commit their own brand of violence by refusing to bargain in good faith for an end to the strike. The company is using its financial might as a club over the workers. The management of Bridgestone/Firestone wants nothing less than complete capitulation by the members of the United Rubber Workers union. The union is trying to hang on to benefits gained over the years in legitimate negotiating processes. It behooves the rest of us in the community to understand that what is happening out on Second Avenue in Des Moines and at the other Bridgestone/Firestone locations around the country is an attempt to further erode the rights of workers to maintain some control over their own lives, minds and bodies rather than become the de facto property of the company. Do not be fooled by the actions of the management of Bridgestone/Firestone. It is every bit as violent (and more so) as any act of physical violence on the picket line in its destructive effects on human life.—The Rev. Carlos C. Jayne, Des Moines Area Urban Mission Council, The United Methodist Church. Bridgestone/Firestone’s strategy to wear down the striking tire workers is becoming more self-evident: undercut public support by repeatedly making strikers look like the bad guys. Three recent examples are instructive: (1) In firing 12 union members, a company spokesman cited ‘‘violence, threats, and aggressive behavior’’ as the reason for dismissal. (2) Firestone’s request for an injunction limiting the number of picketers implied that strikers in groups larger than two presented a danger to company employees. (3) During a peaceful march, when a handful of strike supporters (many from out of state) threw snowballs toward the plant, the company and TV stations described the event as a ‘‘riot.’’ This amounted to an absurd exaggeration. But the message to viewers was ‘‘These guys are dangerous.’’ Since the strike began, I have visited the picket line 20 or 30 times and have spoken with maybe 100 striking tire workers. I have yet to meet a single one who condones the isolated acts of violence that have occurred on both sides of the conflict. In fact, given the financial and emotional hardships they have suffered, the strikers deserve praise for the extent to which they have remained peaceful and nonviolent. Firestone’s focus on violence may sell to the media, but it distracts public attention from the real issue: Management wants more concessions, while the union feels it’s already given up enough. Given the workers’ solidarity and the fairness of their position, I am convinced this strike will end only when the company agrees to come to the VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES562 January 6, 1995 table and talk.—Ed Fallon, State representative.

Mr. President, as a result of committee assignments announced yesterday, I have the privilege and delight to be a member, for the next 2 years, of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. I want to take this opportunity to discuss, in general, why I feel that assignment to be so significant and why I feel so privileged to be a member of a committee with the jurisdiction that it possesses. I also want to discuss one specific issue which has been discussed in that committee in the past, which I regard as being of peculiar and special importance. First, however, I express my delight in being a member of the committee chaired by the distinguished junior Senator from Kansas [Mrs. KASSEBAUM] who has been, during the course of the last Congress, my seat mate in this part of the body and will continue to be so. I look forward to her leadership and to her wise advice and counsel. Issues which will come before the Labor Committee include many that are of vital concern to all Americans in today’s world. These issues include those relating to aging, to disability policies, overwhelmingly to education, to families and children, to employment, and to productivity. I see two profound tidal changes in American society today that are driving the concerns of millions upon millions of our people. As the United States is in the midst of an inevitable shift of its economic base from an industrial/manufacturing system to an information-based economy, millions of families find their justified expectations shattered and find themselves in a new and very difficult world. This shift gives every promise of being as cataclysmic as the shift from an agrarian-based economy to an industrial- based economy in the latter part of the last century and the beginning of this century. Understandably, many people are deeply concerned and apprehensive about this change, about the direction in which our country is heading, and wish that it were not so. It is so, however, and we need to meet that challenge. The American people understand that the societal contract is changing and that we must change with it. Today, the receipt of a high school diploma, or for that matter a college diploma, lacks the meaning it once had. Some families, some people are stuck on welfare and have few, if any, alternatives which they see as being viable. Today, there is no such thing as guaranteed lifetime employment. Working families find it more and more difficult to get ahead. Sending both parents into the workplace used to be a matter of choice, sometimes as a fulfillment for the second spouse to be employed, sometimes as an option to help a family buy a new home or to take a special trip. Today, for far too many, it is not a choice but a necessity. It makes or breaks a family’s budget. And without two paychecks, bills would not be paid and the children might not be fed. Women in the workplace still find themselves stuck in either clerical or middle management positions and their growth stopped dead short by a glass ceiling that has not yet disappeared. Families are still deeply concerned about health care; some cannot change jobs for fear of losing their insurance; others let illness drag on because there is no money to pay in an uninsured situation; and many worry about retirement security. No individual wants to spend his or her golden years being taken care of, being dependent upon their children. But it seems increasingly difficult to save money for retirement. All of this I believe to be the most significant cause of the consistently found proposition that the majority of the American people feel that the country is moving in the wrong direction, that the programs of this Government do not help, but actually hinder, the ability of our citizens efficiently to manage their lives in a changing economy. As a result, I am excited and delighted about the challenges and about the prospects of being on a committee that is designed to address precisely these challenges. I believe we need to reorient the programs of the Federal Government to deal with this new reality. Only when this Government understands this changing reality will Americans believe that their Government is once again on the right track. I think the committee and its Members can make a difference. Beyond my desire to work with my distinguished colleague from Kansas and others on these paramount issues, I am convinced that one of the most important issues facing this country today is the need to educate our children in an environment conducive to learning. In the age of information, nothing—nothing at all—is more important to America’s success than a well-educated citizenry. In that connection, I believe the largest single threat to successful edu cation today is the growing spate of violence in our schools. A year ago this month, I held an education conference in Fife, WA, at which educators and parents from across Washington State spent an entire day discussing what the Federal Government could do to improve our system of education. For the first time in a long career, the No. 1 priority was not more money, it was not more teachers in specific areas, it was not longer school days. The men and women and kids at this conference talked about school violence. In Washington State, violent crimes by young people have doubled in the past decade in spite of a 3-percent drop in the number of students. Recently, our superintendent of public instruction released a report that calculated a total of 2,237 incidents of firearms or dangerous weapons violations reported by school districts and by private schools. And just today, of course, in the Washington Post, we see of a gun- induced killing at the very door of one of the high schools in the District of Columbia. Teachers and parents from all around Washington State have shared with me horror stories of violence in their childrens’ schools: First graders threatening their peers with screwdrivers; a fourth grader extorting lunch money at knife point; a sixth grader who brought a fake but real-looking gun to school and threatened fellow students’ lives with it. How can we expect our children to learn calculus and Tolstoy when they are afraid of walking the halls between classes? On the issue of school violence, the role of the Federal Government has not been a positive one. This Government has not concerned itself sufficiently with the safety of children threatened by these violent students. The Federal Government does not concern themselves with the safety of the faculty and administrators in these schools. It does not seem sufficiently concerned with the disruptive impact of violence in the learning process. In fact, the rules and regulations pursuant to statutes passed by this Congress on the part of the Federal Government has severely limited the ability of local school officials and teachers to deal effectively with violence in our schools. It has, in many respects, tied their hands. It has set up a double standard, depending upon the classification of students in our schools, with respect to the discipline of violent students who bring guns into the schools. Mr. President, this is profoundly the wrong direction in which to go. I am frustrated because the Federal Government, in fact, is making it far more difficult for communities to create an environment in our schools conducive to learning. As a result, last year, I led a VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S563 January 6, 1995 fight on two separate occasions, with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut [Mr. LIEBERMAN], which would restore to schools the authority to deal with this growing tide of violence. Our amendment, considered radical by many in this body, said that school districts in Morton, WA, for example, or in Bridgeport, CT, for example, were in a far better position than was any Federal bureaucrat to judge what was necessary to combat this rising and disruptive wave of violence. Although on both occasions our amendment was accepted first by a voice vote and secondly by an overwhelming majority, in each occasion it was dropped in conference. I felt so strongly about this provision that I voted against the final passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act late last fall. There are, of course, some who will continue to disagree with this goal, who will continue to find that only the Federal Government is capable of making value judgments among students when violence is at issue. I am certainly going to be willing to work with those who disagree and to craft a policy that will attempt to deal with their concerns. But our primary goal, one which cannot be compromised, must be to restore local control to the educators—who are on the firing line, who are in the classroom—the right, the privilege, and the duty to deal with school violence. I intend to work, as a member of the Labor Committee, to ensure that the Federal Government does not stand in the way of educating our children in a safe and positive environment. I invite all of the school teachers and principals and their organizations around the country who have stories to tell about how Federal rules and regulations have tied their hands when it comes to dealing with violent students to contact me, to contact my staff, to contact the committee. I want to know how I can make certain that the Federal Government does not make this problem worse. I want you to know that this Senator trusts the teachers and administrators of the schools of this country and wants to give to them the flexibility to deal with these challenges. We must do everything we can to ensure that our children go to school in an environment conducive to learning, and that means an environment safe for them and for their teachers.

A bill to provide for restitution of victims of crimes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. CRIME VICTIMS RESTITUTION ACT Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to reintroduce the Crime Victims Restitution Act. Last fall when the Senate passed it’s version of the crime bill, I lauded the inclusion of my victim’s rights and mandatory restitution provisions in the legislation. Three years ago, I introduced the Victim’s Rights and Restitution Act, and many of those victim’s rights provisions passed as part of the 1990 crime bill. However, each time this restitution provision has passed the Senate it has subsequently been dropped in conference. Pasage of this legislation would signal a great victory for all victims of crime. If these provisions become law, crime victims will enjoy rights at the Federal level that many States already guarantee. Most important are the act’s restitution provisions, making criminals pay for their crimes. Under the legislation, crime victims will be entitled to receive full financial compensation directly from the criminal in the form of mandatory restitution. Over the last several years, it seems we have continuously debated what should be done to improve our Nation’s judicial system. Now is the time to do something about it. I strongly believe our judicial system needs fundamental reform to help our police officers and courts deal with the overwhelming increase in crime. Furthermore, it is crucial that while trying to facilitate more effective and efficient methods of dealing with criminals, we must not forget about the most important part of the crime-fighting equation: The victims. In 1990, I authored the crime victim’s bill of rights which passed as part of the 1990 crime bill. For crimes tried in Federal court, victims now have the right to be notified of and involved in court proceedings, the right to be protected from the accused, the right to be treated fairly and with respect, and the right to be informed of the detention status of the convicted criminal. However, passage of just the victims rights portion of my proposal left some unfinished business. Crime victims should be entitled to compensation for losses sustained from their victimization. This glaring inequity was remedied in the crime bill when it passed the Senate last year. It contained mandates that courts order restitution in all Federal criminal cases. Victims would be able to recover financial losses resulting from the criminal act. This restitution order would be a condition of any form of release for the offender. The legislation would ensure that the criminal not only pays his debt to society, but he also pays his debt to his victim. However, the Democrats in the House voted to delete these provisions from the final crime bill. The provisions of this legislation also overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Hughey case which stated restitution could not be ordered for crimes beyond the scope of the offense of conviction. So, if a criminal is convicted of a criminal offense, but plea bargains his way out of a conviction on a second offense, he cannot be held responsible to repay the victim of the second offense. This obvious shortcoming would be corrected by allowing the court to consider the course of criminal conduct and order restitution for crimes other than the offense of conviction. Plea bargains should not result in victims being denied the justice they deserve which certainly includes full restitution from the offender. Over the years mandatory restitution has received the written endorsements of victim rights experts across the Nation including the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Victim Center, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. This landmark victim’s legislation needs to be enacted into law. Mandatory restitution, while not healing all the wounds associated with a crime, will provide some compensation to help people who have been victimized and allow them to get their lives back in order. If Congress reconsiders crime legislation this year, these provisions certainly need to be a part of the final bill. f ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS S. 3 At the request of Mr. DOLE, the name of the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. SMITH] was added as a cosponsor of S. 3, a bill to control crime, and for other purposes. S. 145 At the request of Mr. GRAMM, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. GRASSLEY] was added as a cosponsor of S. 145, a bill to provide appropriate protection for the constitutional guarantee of private property rights, and for other purposes.

RES. 31 Whereas there are approximately 900 clin ics in the United States providing reproductive health services; Whereas violence directed at persons seeking to provide reproductive health services continues to increase in the United States, as demonstrated by the recent shootings at two reproductive health clinics in Massachusetts and another health care clinic in Virginia; Whereas organizations monitoring clinic violence have recorded over 130 incidents of violence or harassment directed at reproductive health care clinics and their personnel in 1994 such as death threats, stalking, chemical attacks, bombings and arson; Whereas there has been one attempted murder in Florida and four individuals killed at reproductive health care clinics in Florida and Massachusetts in 1994; Whereas the Congress passed and the President signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, a law establishing Federal criminal penalties and civil remedies for certain violent, threatening, obstructive and destructive conduct that is intended to injure, intimidate or interfere with persons seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services; Whereas violence is not a mode of free speech and should not be condoned as a method of expressing an opinion; Whereas persons exercising their constitutional rights and acting completely within the law are entitled to full protection from the Federal Government; Whereas the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 imposes a mandate on the Federal Government to protect individuals seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services; and Whereas the Attorney General has at her disposal law enforcement personnel including 10,000 FBI agents and over 2,000 members of the United States Marshals Service: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the United States Attorney General should fully enforce the law and take any further necessary measures to protect persons seeking to provide or obtain, or assist in providing or obtaining, reproductive health services from violent attack.

Mr. President, today I am submitting legislation calling on the Attorney General to take all necessary measures to protect reproductive health care clinics and their staff from violent attack. I know that many of my colleagues are as shocked as I am about the ongoing terror and violence directed at our Nation’s family planning clinics. That is why I am pleased that my legislation has bipartisan support. In 1994 there were over 130 incidents nationwide of violence or harassment directed at clinics and the people who work there. They include 50 reports of death threats to doctors and other clinic workers, 40 incidents of vandalism, 16 incidents of stalking, 4 acts of arson and 3 attempted bombings. Tragically, since the murder of Dr. David Gunn in March, 1993 outside of the Pensacola Women’s Health Clinic there have been four additional slayings at clinics. In July, 1994 Dr. John Britton and his escort Jim Barret were shot to death at The Ladies’ Center in Pensacola, FL. Mr. Barret’s wife was injured. On December 30, Shannon Lowney and Leanne Nichols were shot and killed while working at reproductive health care clincs in Massachusetts. Five others were wounded. A day later the gunman fired shots at another clinic in Virginia. The resolution I am submitting today urges the Attorney General to use all of the tools at her disposal to stop this escalating violence, including the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act which we passed last year, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service. I urge my colleagues to join me in working to protect our Nation’s reproductive health care clinics from violent attack. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the murderous assaults at two clinics in Brookline, Massachusetts last week were despicable acts of terrorism. This kind of vicious, hateful assault against women and health care providers cannot be tolerated in any community in America. Two women who worked at the Brookline clinics, Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols, had their lives brutally cut short. Five other people were seriously wounded, and four of them are still hospitalized. My heart goes out to these victims and their families. No effort can be spared to make sure that these crimes are not repeated anywhere else. Women must be able to seek reproductive health care without fear of violent assault. Doctors should be able to practice their profession without wearing bullet-proof vests. Clinic staff should be able to go to work each day in safety. Abortion is a constitutionally protected right, and it must be safe and accessible. Many of the clinics targeted by violence and obstruction provide a wide range of health care services for women, including family planning and prenatal care. We cannot allow access to these important services to be reduced or blocked. Last year, we passed and President Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. That law gives the Attorney General the tools she needs to prevent violence and obstruction and to punish such acts whenever and wherever they occur with the full force of Federal law. The Justice Department has already brought several enforcement actions under this law, and it is actively investigating other possible violations. In addition, the Attorney General has made U.S. Marshals available to protect clinics. Some have suggested that the new Federal law is somehow responsible for fomenting violence at abortion clinics, because it allegedly closes off peaceful picketing as an outlet for those with strongly held views against abortion. Any such suggestion is nonsense. The clinic access law does not prohibit or punish peaceful picketing or any other expression protected by the first amendment. On the contrary, it expressly allows it. What the act prohibits is violent, threatening, obstructive, or destructive conduct—none of which has ever been protected by the Constitution. For that reason, every one of the Federal courts that have been asked to review the law since President Clinton signed it last year has upheld it. Tough laws against clinic blockades and clinic violence are not the problem. They are the solution. I commend President Clinton and Attorney General Reno for their vigorous enforcement of the new Federal law, and for their commitment to work with local law enforcement authorities to protect the clinics throughout the country. They are doing everything in their power to guarantee public safety and deter the use of violent tactics aimed at patients and providers. I am proud to join in sponsoring this legislation. The Senate must go on record unequivocally to denounce the violence, and to express our solid support for vigorous enforcement and implementation of the Federal clinic protection law. I hope that every Member of the Senate will join in supporting this important measure. f SENATE RESOLUTION 32—MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS TO SENATE COMMITTEES Mr. DASCHLE submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: S.

Mr. President, on January 4, 1995, I introduced S. 135, the Property Rights Litigation Relief Act of 1995. Because of the great interest shown in the bill, I ask that it be printed in the RECORD at this point. The bill follows: S. 135 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Property Rights Litigation Relief Act of 1995’’. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that— (1) the private ownership of property is es sential to a free society and is an integral part of the American tradition of liberty and limited government; (2) the framers of the United States Constitution, in order to protect private property and liberty, devised a framework of Government designed to diffuse power and limit Government; (3) to further ensure the protection of private property, the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified to prevent the taking of private property by the Federal Government, except for public use and with just compensation; (4) the purpose of the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution, as the Supreme Court stated in Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960), is ‘‘to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole’’; (5) the Federal Government, in its haste to ameliorate public harms and environmental abuse, has singled out property holders to shoulder the cost that should be borne by the public, in violation of the just compensation requirement of the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution; (6) there is a need to both restrain the Federal Government in its overzealous regulation of the private sector and to protect private property, which is a fundamental right of the American people; (7) the incremental, fact-specific approach that courts now are required to employ in the absence of adequate statutory language to vindicate property rights under the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution has been ineffective and costly and there is a need for Congress to clarify the law and provide an effective remedy; (8) certain provisions of sections 1346 and 1402 and chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as the Tucker Act), that delineates the jurisdiction of courts hearing property rights claims, complicates the ability of a property owner to vindicate a property owner’s right to just compensation for a governmental action that has caused a physical or regulatory taking; (9) current law— (A) forces a property owner to elect be tween equitable relief in the district court and monetary relief (the value of the property taken) in the United States Court of Federal Claims; (B) is used to urge dismissal in the district court on the ground that the plaintiff should seek just compensation in the Court of Federal Claims; and (C) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal Claims on the ground that plaintiff should seek equitable relief in district court; (10) property owners cannot fully vindicate property rights in one court; (11) property owners should be able to fully recover for a taking of their private property in one court; (12) certain provisions of section 1346 and 1402 and chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as the Tucker Act) should be amended, giving both the district courts of the United States and the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to hear all claims relating to property rights; and (13) section 1500 of title 28, United States Code, which denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain a suit which is pending in another court and made by the same plaintiff, should be repealed. SEC. 3. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to— (1) encourage, support, and promote the private ownership of property by ensuring the constitutional and legal protection of private property by the United States Government; (2) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient judicial process whereby aggrieved property owners can obtain vindication of property rights guaranteed by the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution and this Act; (3) amend certain provisions of the Tucker Act, including the repeal of section 1500 of title 28, United States Code; (4) rectify the constitutional imbalance between the Federal Government and the States; and (5) require the Federal Government to compensate property owners for the deprivation of property rights that result from State agencies’ enforcement of federally mandated programs. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

(b) BURDEN OF PROOF.—(1) The Government shall bear the burden of proof in any action described under— (A) subsection (a)(2)(A), with regard to showing the nexus between the stated governmental purpose of the governmental interest and the impact on the proposed use of private property; (B) subsection (a)(2)(B), with regard to showing the proportionality between the exaction and the impact of the proposed use of the property; and (C) subsection (a)(2)(C), with regard to showing that such deprivation of value inheres in the title to the property. (2) The property owner shall have the burden of proof in any action described under subsection (a)(2)(D), with regard to establishing the diminution of value of property. (c) COMPENSATION AND NUISANCE EXCEPTION TO PAYMENT OF JUST COMPENSATION.—(1) No compensation shall be required by this Act if the owner’s use or proposed use of the property is a nuisance as commonly understood and defined by background principles of nuisance and property law, as understood within the State in which the property is situated, and to bar an award of damages under this Act, the United States shall have the burden of proof to establish that the use or proposed use of the property is a nuisance. (2) Subject to paragraph (1), if an agency action directly takes property or a portion of property under subsection (a), compensation to the owner of the property that is affected by the action shall be either the greater of an amount equal to— (A) the difference between— (i) the fair market value of the property or portion of the property affected by agency action before such property became the subject of the specific government regulation; and (ii) the fair market value of the property or portion of the property when such property becomes subject to the agency action; or (B) business losses. (d) TRANSFER OF PROPERTY INTEREST.—The United States shall take title to the property interest for which the United States pays a claim under this Act. (e) SOURCE OF COMPENSATION.—The compensation referred to in this section shall be paid out of funds made available to the Federal agency or department by appropriation for the fiscal year in which the property deprivation referred to in this section occurred. If no such funds have been made available to the agency, such payment shall be made from the Judgment Fund. SEC. 6. JURISDICTION AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. (a) IN GENERAL.—A property owner may file a civil action under this Act to challenge the validity of any agency action that adversely affects the owner’s interest in private property in either the United States District Court or the United States Court of Federal Claims. This section constitutes express waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States. Notwithstanding any other provision of law and notwithstanding the issues involved, the relief sought, or the amount in controversy, each court shall have concurrent jurisdiction over both claims for monetary relief and claims seeking invalidation of any Act of Congress or any regulation of an agency as defined under this Act affecting private property rights. The plaintiff shall have the election of the court in which to file a claim for relief. (b) STANDING.—Persons adversely affected by an agency action taken under this Act shall have standing to challenge and seek judicial review of that action. (c) AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 28, UNITED STATES CODE.—(1) Section 1491(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended— (A) in paragraph (1) by amending the first sentence to read as follows: ‘‘The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States for monetary relief founded either upon the Constitution or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, in cases not sounding in tort, or for invalidation of any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department that adversely affects private property rights in violation of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution’’; (B) in paragraph (2) by inserting before the first sentence the following: ‘‘In any case within its jurisdiction, the Court of Federal Claims shall have the power to grant injunctive and declaratory relief when appropriate.’’; and (C) by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraphs: ‘‘(4) In cases otherwise within its jurisdiction, the Court of Federal Claims shall also have ancillary jurisdiction, concurrent with the courts designated in section 1346(b) of this title, to render judgment upon any related tort claim authorized under section 2674 of this title. ‘‘(5) In proceedings within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims which constitute judicial review of agency action (rather than de novo proceedings), the provisions of section 706 of title 5 shall apply.’’.

Mr. President, in an unusual publication called simply ‘‘Constitution,’’ published by the Foundation for the United States Constitution, there is an article by Professor Harold Hongju Koh of Yale University titled, ‘‘Bitter Fruit of the Asian Immigration Cases.’’ It interested me because of my long association with the cause of civil rights and because I grew up in the State of Oregon and recall the criticism my father took when, as a Lutheran minister, he objected to the 1942 unconstitutional transfer of Japanese American citizens away from the West Coast. Another reason for my interest is that I serve on the Senate Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs. Our record in the field of immigration has not always been a good one, and that is particularly true as it applies to the Asian community. There is no question that we face problems in the field of immigration, but the answer is not passing things like Proposition 187 in California or the other abuses that we have tolerated through the history of our country. I believe my colleagues will find the article by Professor Koh a matter of more than casual interest. At this point, I ask that it be printed in the RECORD. The article follows: BITTER FRUIT OF THE ASIAN IMMIGRATION CASES (By Harold Hongju Koh) Schoolchildren everywhere can recite the Statue of Liberty’s inspirational message about ‘‘huddled masses, yearning to breathe free.’’ Yet history shows that our national attitude toward immigrants has been as hostile as it has been solicitious—especially in hard times. One need only look at today’s headlines. As we endure our latest recession, newspapers report polls showing that 60 percent of Americans believe current levels of immigration are too high. News stories tell of the government’s harsh policies toward Haitian and Chinese refugees, of public concern over the illicit smuggling of aliens, of anti-immigrant sentiment spurred by the World Trade Center bombing, and of lawsuits brought by California, Texas and Florida against the federal government to recoup costs arising from the influx of undocumented aliens. Politicians, says the New York Times, call for ‘‘a get-tough effort to control immigration . . . prompted by polls showing that the issue is gaining an importance among voters . . . increasingly worried about the economic impact of immigrants and their effect on American culture.’’ Not only is immigrant bashing as American as apple pie, but bias against immigrants has helped shape our constitutional law. Occasionally, the bias has been overt: a proposed constitutional amendment, for example, (favored, apparently, by 49 percent of Americans) would deny citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented aliens. And ‘‘reforms’’ that hurt immigrants have emerged as themes embroidered on Supreme Court decisions. It has been a long time since Justice Harry Blackmun led a unanimous Supreme Court to declare that ‘‘aliens as a class are a prime example of a discrete and insular minority . . . for whom . . . heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate’’ Graham v. Richardson, 1971). His last major immigration opinion Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, 1993) was a solitary dissent decrying the summary return of Haitian refugees to a brutal dictatorship without first granting them a hearing. In his dissent, Blackmun laid bare the themes that run through the modern Court’s immigration and naturalization jurisprudence: an obsession with sovereignty and governmental power, an unwillingness to scrutinize the immigration decisions of government officials, contempt for international law and indifference to the due process and equal protection claims of foreigners seeking entry to the United States. Where and when did these attitudes originate? The latest volume of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise: History of the Supreme Court, Owen Fiss’s impressive Troubled Beginnings of the Modern State, 1888–1910, illuminates a source: a series of Asian immigration cases decided by the Court in the late 19th century. Before these cases, immigration into the United States went virtually unregulated, driven by the perceived need to remedy underpopulation. Indeed, the Declaration of Independence assailed the King of England for ‘‘endeavor[ing] to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; [and] refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither. . . .’’ The Constitution’s framers responded with the fourth clause of Article I, Section 8, which granted Congress power to ‘‘establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.’’ In 1790 Congress invoked new power to pass a law permitting only ‘‘free white persons’’ to naturalize, a right not granted to Asian immigrants until 1952. Significantly, this language did not authorize Congress to regulate the admission of aliens who might seek citizenship. In fact, another clause of Article I forbade Congress to prohibit the ‘‘Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit’’ before 1808. Designed to protect the slave trade, the clause was invoked by Jeffersonians to challenge the constitutionality of the Alien Act of 1798, which authorized the President to expel ‘‘all such aliens as he shall judge dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.’’ During the years of free immigration few Asians came to these shores. Between 1820, when immigration records were first kept, and 1849, when the California Gold Rush began, only 43 Chinese were reported to have arrived in America. But once gold was discovered, thousands of Chinese miners flooded into ‘‘Kumshan’’—the Golden Moutain—as they called California. In 1850, 4,000 Chinese arrived in California. The next year the Chinese population stood at 25,000; in 1852, 45,000. These immigrants—mostly men who had left their families in China—came to work the mines. But by the mid-1860s, thousands had depleted their mining claims or been forced off them. They found work on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, building the Central Pacific Railroad; in one year the company procured 15,000 laborers. Other Chinese opened laundries, restaurants and small shops, or worked as gardeners, domestic servants, farmers, fishermen, mechanics and artisans. By the mid-1870s, some 115,000 Chinese lived in the United States, 70 percent in California, where one person in 10 was Chinese. The first Chinese were welcomed with curiosity. In 1852 the governor of California claimed he wanted ‘‘further immigration and settlement of the Chinese—one of the most worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens.’’ But by the 1860s hospitality had soured. White workers assailed the Chinese for working too hard for too little, while the popular press vilified them as lairs, criminals, prostitutes and opium addicts. Unlike the European immigrants then flooding into the United States, the Chinese were thought unassimilable. In Justice Stephen Field’s works, ‘‘they remained strangers in the land, residing apart by themselves, and adhering to the customs and usages of their own country. As they grew in numbers each year, the people of the [West] coast saw, or believed they saw . . . great danger that at no distant day that portion of our country would be overrun by them unless prompt action was taken to restrict their immigration.’’ When drought and depression hit California in the early 1860s, the Chinese were scapegoated. ‘‘To an American,’’ the 1876 manifesto of the Workingmen’s Party of California declared, ‘‘death is preferable to life on a par with the Chinaman.’’ California and its cities began to enact restrictive laws. The first were revenue measures (such as entry, license and occupation taxes) and other laws neutral on their face but applied harshly against the Chinese. Chinese paid 98 percent of the monies collected under the California Foreign Miner’s Tax, for example, and an 1870 law authorizing the state’s immigration commissioner to remove ‘‘debauched women’’ was quickly applied to Chinese women arriving by ship. Soon the laws became overtly racist; a San Francisco ordinance required all Chinese residents to move to prescribed ghettoes, and another humiliated Chinese prisoners in the county jail by requiring them to cut their queues to one inch in length. Between 1855 and 1870 California passed acts bearing such titles as ‘‘An Act to Discourage the Immigration to This State of Persons Who Cannot Become Citizens,’’ ‘‘An Act to Protect Free White Labor Against Competition with Chinese Coolie Labor’’ and ‘‘An Act to Prevent the Further Immigration of Chinese or Mongolians to This State.’’ Chinese were denied the vote and the rights to own or inherit land, to testify in court, to attend public schools with VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES570 January 6, 1995 whites or to live in the same neighborhoods as whites. In 1879 California’s new constitution asserted that ‘‘the presence of foreigners ineligible to become citizens . . . is dangerous to the well-being of the State, and the Legislature shall discourage their immigration by all means within its power.’’ Meanwhile, assaults on the Chinese became commonplace. In 1871 a Los Angeles race riot killed 19 Chinese. In September 1885, 28 Chinese laborers in a settlement near Rock Springs, Wyoming, were brutally murdered, and vigilantes killed several Chinese residents of the Washington territories. The next year mobs invaded the Chinese sections of several West Coast cities and forced residents out. Across Washington, Oregon and California, mass meetings demanded the expulsion of Chinese. California’s restrictiveness contrasted sharply with federal immigration policy. An 1868 act of Congress declared that the right to leave the land of one’s birth and resettle elsewhere was ‘‘a natural and inherent right of all people,’’ in recognition of which the United states ‘‘has freely received emigrants from all nations and invested them with rights of citizenship.’’ That year the United States and China concluded the Burlingame Treaty to improve trade with China and encourage the immigration of coolies to build the railroads. The treaty recognized that free migration and an ‘‘inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance’’ were matters of ‘‘mutual advantage’’ for both nations. by its terms, Chinese could become ‘‘permanent residents’’ of the United States. Federal receptivity extended not just to immigration but also to citizenship by birth. In 1866, two years before the Burlingame Treaty, Congress passed a civil rights law (designed to overturn the 1857 Dred Scott decision) that reaffirmed the citizenship of native-born blacks. Its language was echoed in the birthright citizenship clause of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, soon to be drafted by Congress: ‘‘All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.’’ California Senator John Conness supported this language and declared his desire for equal rights for children of Chinese parentage. By accepting the clause, notes constitutional scholar Gerald Neuman, Congress ‘‘refused the invitation to create an hereditary caste of voteless denizens, vulnerable to expulsion and exploitation.’’ But the tide soon changed. In 1872 political pressure led President Ulysses S. Grant to call for legislation to counteract the evils associated with Chinese immigration. The resulting Immigration Act of 1875 was the first federal legislation to control immigration. It outlawed contracts to supply coolie labor, barred importation of aliens without their consent and made it illegal to bring in women for purposes of prostitution. As applied against the Chinese, the restrictionist statute seemed inconsistent with the spirit of the Burlingame Treaty. Four years later President Rutherford Hayes invoked the treaty to veto a bill forbidding ships to bring more than 15 Chinese at a time into the country. But in 1880, under pressure from Congress, Hayes renegotiated the Burlingame Treaty to recognize America’s right to regulate, limit and suspend Chinese immigration. Two years later Congress enacted the first Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended immigration of Chinese, with minor exceptions, for 10 years. That law was amended and reenacted repeatedly and was not finally revoked until 1943. The 1882 act expressly prohibited the naturalization of Chinese as American citizens and denied entry to the wives of Chinese, even perma nent U.S. residents—a restriction that continued for the next 60 years. This shortage of women forced many Chinese laborers to return to China simply to marry or have families. In 1884 Congress amended the exclusion law to require returning Chinese laborers to produce certificates of residence signed by two non-Chinese American citizens—a requisite designed to thwart ‘‘the notorious capabilities of the lower classes of Chinese for perjury.’’ The act was soon challenged. Chae Chan Ping, a Chinese laborer who had entered the United States lawfully in 1875, obtained the required certificate of residence before visiting China in 1887. In 1888, shortly before he was to return, Congress amended the Exclusion Act to revoke all reentry certificates. Chae Chan Ping was denied reentry, and he sued. He challenged the amended Chinese Exclusion Act on the grounds that it violated the Constitution’s due process and equal protection clauses and conflicted with the Burlingame Treaty. In other times his case would have seemed easy. But a unanimous Court rejected his claim and in the process laid down the five planks of our modern immigration jurisprudence. Justice Stephen J. Field wrote the opinion. The first plank came with Field’s title, the Chinese Exclusion case, an inapt name for a case that actually concerned the reentry of a longtime resident. By framing the case as an analysis of the federal government’s supposed power to exclude, Field portrayed Chae Chan Ping’s claim as an assault on the Chinese Exclusion Act, which he defined as the statutory expression of an inherent, unenumerated foreign-affairs power that lay beyond substantive constitutional attack. This power, he said, was an essential feature of national sovereignty. That ‘‘the government of the United States. . .can exclude aliens from its territories,’’ he declared, ‘‘is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. . .The power of exclusion of foreigners being an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States, as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the Constitution, the right to its exercise at any time, when, in the judgment of the government, the interests of the country require it, cannot be granted away or restrained on behalf of any one.’’ Justice Field conceded that the 1888 act violated the open terms of the Burlingame Treaty. But, he concluded, the act was ‘‘not on that account invalid,’’ since statutes and treaties are equivalent federal laws, and the most recent controls. In effect, he suggested, laying down what became the second plank of the Court’s immigration jurisprudence, Congress has the power not just to disregard but also to abrogate solemn treaty obligations. Third, Field noted, a Chinese laborer’s right to reenter the United States ‘‘is held at the will of the government, revocable at any time, at its pleasure,’’ despite any due process claim. Although the Court did not elaborate on that conclusion, later decisions have construed it as resting on several implicit premises: that perhaps the Constitution does not apply to aliens outside the United States; that a person’s right to return home is neither a ‘‘liberty’’ nor a ‘‘property’’ interest protected by constitutional due process; or that an individual’s due process interest can be outweighed by the public’s interest in ‘‘preserv[ing] its independence, and giving] security against foreign aggression and encroachment.’’ As the constitutional scholar Louis Henkin has noted, ‘‘whatever the Court intended, both its holding and its sweeping dictum have been taken to mean that there are no constitutional limitations on the power of Congress to regulate immigration.’’ The fourth plank was an omission. In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, decided only three years earlier, the Court had held a San Francisco ordinance invalid under the 14th Amendment, based on evidence that it was applied dicriminatorily against Chinese launderers. Here the Court never examined whether, by extension, the federal exclusion laws also offended the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Finally, Justice Field labeled the government’s actions a ‘‘political question’’ that barred judicial review. ‘‘Whether a proper consideration by our government of its previous laws, or a proper respect for the nation whose subjects are affected by its action, ought to have qualified its inhibition and made it applicable only to persons departing from the country after the passage of the act are not questions for judicial determination,’’ he wrote. During the next decade the Court expanded upon each principle in a series of Asian immigration cases. In Nishimura Ekiu v. United States (1892), it backed an immigration official who refused a Japanese woman admission to the United States, relying on a statute authorizing such refusal if in the official’s opinion immigrants were likely to become ‘‘public charges.’’ Justice Horace Gray delivered the opinion upholding the act, repeating Field’s language about a sovereign nation’s power to exclude aliens. Since the statute had granted the officer discretionary power, Gray reasoned, ‘‘no other tribunal. . .is at liberty to reexamine or controvert the sufficiency of the evidence on which he acted.’’ A year later, in Fong Yue Ting v. United States (1893), Gray expanded those claims. At issue was whether a Chinese laborer, a U.S. resident for 14 years and, of course, barred from becoming a citizen, could be arrested and expelled for lacking a certificate of residence. Based on the testimony of a Chinese witness, a federal judge had found that the laborer was a permanent resident of the United States. But Gray extended Field’s arguments from the Chinese Exclusion case. He recognized an ‘‘absolute and unqualified’’ governmental right not just to exclude aliens who have never entered, but ‘‘to expel or deport foreigners, who have not been naturalized or taken any step toward becoming citizens.’’ In an incredible catch–22, Gray turned Fong Yue Ting’s acceptance of a legal disability (his inability to become a naturalized American citizen) into a justification for barring him from his adopted home. In so doing he rejected both due process and equal protection claims. In Fiss’s words, he left ‘‘Yick Wo on the books but denied it any operative effect.’’ In 1895 the Court added the last piece of the puzzle. Lem Moon Sing, a Chinese druggist permanently domiciled in San Francisco, visited his native home. Upon being denied reentry in 1894, he provided proof of his prior residence from two credible non- Chinese witnesses, but he was nevertheless restrained and confined. Writing for the Court, the elder Justice John Marshall Harlan upheld the denial of Lem Moon Sing’s writ of habeas corpus, reasoning that a decision of an immigration official to deny an alien admission to the United States could not be reexamined in a habeas corpus proceeding (Lem Moon Sing v. United States). The decision had two startling results. First, it transformed the doctrine of plenary federal power over exclusion from a congressional power to an executive authority, once Congress had delegated it to executive officials. Second, the case made clear that courts could not intervene to examine even blatant VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S571 January 6, 1995 misuses of the exclusion power by immigration officials. Thus, as this century began, the Court viewed Congress’s power to control immigration—nowhere specified in the Constitution—as complete, inherent and mandated by sovereignty and international law. That power overrode state law, prior treaties and fundamental constitutional protections, and it could be exercised virtually free from judicial scrutiny. A doctrine so sweeping attracted criticism. The extension of the power to exclude, granted in Chinese Exclusion, to deportation and expulsion proved too much even for Justice Field, who not only dissented but also wrote a letter urging that additional members be added to the Court, reasoning that ‘‘where [a] decision goes to the very essentials of Constitutional Government, the question of an increase of the bench may properly be considered and acted upon.’’ But as Fiss reveals, the one consistent and enlightened critic of the Asian immigration decisions was Field’s nephew, Justice David Brewer, who dissented in Nishimura Ekiu, Fong Yue Ting and Lem Moon Sing, showing the kind of clarity and inde pendence of mind that marked him as the Blackmun of his day. The son of missionary parents in Asia Minor, Brewer was one of the few Justices who sought to understand the role of aliens in the constitutional community. In his Fong Yue Ting dissent, he highlighted the racist character of the law in question, asking, ‘‘In view of this enactment of the highest legislative body of the foremost Christian nation, may not the thoughtful Chinese disciple of Confucius fairly ask, Why do they send missionaries here?’’ For all his enlightenment, even Brewer did not argue that the Constitution’s protections applied outside the United States. To the contrary, his Fong Yue Ting dissent declared that ‘‘the Constitution has no extraterritorial effect, and those who have not come lawfully within our territory cannot claim any protection from its provisions.’’ Years later the Court would exploit that loophole by creating a legal fiction— that even aliens who have physically entered the United States remain legally outside it, thereby intentionally denying even longtime residents of this country meaningful constitutional protection. As the century turned, the question of whether aliens outside the United States have constitutional rights was absorbed by the larger issue of ‘‘whether the Constitution follows the flag’’—that is, whether the Constitution extends to the furthest reaches of the emerging American empire. The characteristic executive-branch response to this question, ascribed by Fiss to Secretary of War Elihu Root, was, ‘‘As near as I can make out the Constitution follows the flag—but doesn’t quite catch up with it.’’ Only one decision ran against the anti- Asian tide: United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). That case asked whether children born in the United States of Chinese parents became American citizens by virtue of the 14th Amendments birthright citizenship clause. Given the earlier Chinese decisions, the case seemed an uphill struggle. The Chinese Exclusion Act had denied Wong Kim Ark’s parents the opportunity for citizenship through naturalization, and Chae Chan Ping and Fong Yue Ting had settled that those parents could have been deported, expelled or forbidden reentry upon leaving the country. Justice Gray began inauspiciously, asserting that ‘‘the inherent right of every independent nation to determine for itself, and according to its own constitution and laws, what classes of persons shall be entitled to its citizenship. ‘‘Yet surprisingly, he went on to hold that the 14th Amendment denied the federal government the power to withhold citizenship from children born in the United States of alien parents. The decision rested on the birthright citizenship clause, which confers citizenship on U.S.-born persons of parents ‘‘subject to [U.S.] jurisdiction.’’ The Court’s holding that Chinese parents of American-born children were so subject reaffirmed the themes of sovereignty and absolute territorial jurisdiction that ran through the earlier Chinese cases. Ironically, the decision also seems to have been driven by the potential impact of a contrary holding on ethnic groups other than Asians. As Justice Gray noted, ‘‘To hold that the 14th Amendment . . . excludes from citizenship the children born in the United States of citizens or subjects of other countries, would be to deny citizenship of thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage, who always have been considered a citizens of the United States. All this might seem like ancient history, made irrelevant by the New Deal, the Warren court, the Bill of Rights revolution and the global era of international human rights. Nor does it seem plausible that blatantly racist laws could survive after Brown v. Board of Education, the end of official racial discrimination and the advent of strict judicial scrutiny. But our government’s position in recent cases reveals that immigration is caught in a time warp. Chinese refugees, arriving on Long Island’s south shore aboard the Golden Venture, fall squarely within the Chinese Exclusion holding. Poor black Haitian boat people, fleeing persecution after a coup d’état overthrew their first democratically elected government, encounter as obstacles to their entry into the United States claims of inherent sovereignty and plenary congressional power, allegedly delegated to the President and the Coast Guard. Haitians who raise due process and equal protection claims are told that the Constitution does not protect them on the high seas. Their efforts to invoke multilateral and bilateral refugee treaties similarly founder on American claims of territoriality. When Haitians challenge their summary repatriation to Haiti, our government in its defense cites grounds of foreign policy, national security and nonreviewability. Refused admission as public charges and health risks, HIV-positive Haitian asylum seekers are detained for nearly two years in a U.S. government internment camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in an eerie parallel of the government’s internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. At this writing, thousands of Haitians are again detained at Guantanamo. Ironically, the question arises whether Haitian children born in the Guantanamo camp are Haitian, Cuban or perhaps even American citizens. Other infamous decisions from the 19th century, such as Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson (which legalized separate but equal), have been overruled, both at law and in the court of public opinion. But the Asian immigration cases of that era—no less shocking—still bear bitter fruit. Today, no public official would embrace the racism, hatred and nativism that drove those decisions. Yet the legal principles they enunciated still rule our borders.∑ f TRITUTE TO GORO HOKAMA ∑ Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have known Goro Hokama, the outgoing chairman of the county council of the County of Maui, for over 40 years. In the spring of 1954, I recall meeting with him to discuss whether we should consider public service as our life’s career. For 40 years, Goro Hokama has served the people of Maui County as a member of the county council and also chairman of that same body. I wish to share with you and my colleagues the following editorial from the Maui News, dated December 20, 1994, entitled ‘‘Goro Hokama: 40 Years of Service.’’ I believe it expresses the sentiment of many of us who have had the privilege of calling him friend, and the many who have benefited form his leadership. I wish to join the people of Maui County and all of Hawaii in commending and thanking Goro Hokama for his 40 years of dedicated public service. The editorial follows: [From the Maui News, Dec. 20, 1994] GORO HOKAMA: 40 YEARS OF SERVICE 1994’s end will officially bring down the curtain on Goro Hokama’s 40 continuous years of public service to Maui County. It’s impossible to overstate the contributions he has made to this community, and in fact, to the entire state of Hawaii. The departing Maui County Council chairman was first elected to office in 1954, the year of the great political revolution that saw the Democrats snatch the reins of power from the Republicans and by proxy from the big landowners. Hokama was Hawaii’s lone remaining elected county official who had a hand in that historic housecleaning, a staying power made ever more remarkable by his having to face election every two years. U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye is the only person remaining from the 1954 sweep who has served in elected office as long as Hokama, but even he did not have to win 20 straight times to do so. Hokama did. And Hokama won without ever sacrificing his principles, even when it meant risking the loss of longtime supporters. For all of his 40 years on the County Council, or its predecessor, the Board of Supervisors, Hokama held the Lanai residency seat. In more than one election he trailed his opponent when the ballots on Lanai were counted, but with countywide voting he would prevail anyway because of his broad appeal to residents throughout the county. Seeing himself as more than just a Lanai councilman, Hokama clearly understood his role as a county councilman, and his actions reflected that understanding, even if not always to his benefit back home. He learned early, however, not to be frightened off by the odds, working as a union organizer among the pineapple workers on Lanai in the 1940s when unions were a poison to the ruling political and financial powers. And neither was he frightened off nearly 50 years later when the ILWU shockingly refused to endorse him, one of its own, in the election of 1992 because of differences he had with the union leadership over the course of development on Lanai. He won anyway. That was an occasion when he opposed de velopment, and he drew the wrath of labor. On other occasions he supported development, and he drew the wrath of environmentalists. On all of those occasions, however, Hokama acted upon what he believed was right, not on what may have been politically expedient. Maui has repeatedly been cited by economists as the county with the firmest financial footing in the state, and that is due in no small part to Goro Hokama. Fiscally conservative by nature, he nonetheless was a leader in the bold gambles that paid off in the developments of Kaanapali, Wailea and VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES572 January 6, 1995 Kapalua, bringing the full fruits of tourism to bear on Maui’s economy. That economic success story is certainly his chief legacy. His first and only election loss came in November when his bid for mayor was turned back by Linda Crockett Lingle. Hokama again found himself bucking the odds by taking on the popular Republican incumbent, but as always he showed his resolve not to be cowed by the odds. He waged an aggressive and tireless campaign from day one, the only difference being that this time he lost. That he didn’t lose in any of the 20 elections before this one is both a tribute to the man Goro Hokama and a profit to the County of Maui.∑ f STAR WARS OR MAGINOT LINE? CONTRACT TO BANKRUPT AMERICA ∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Republican contract calls for the old star wars program—the strategic defense initiative [SDI]—to be retooled, reinvigorated, and deployed ‘‘at the earliest possible date.’’ We have spent a fortune on this program since 1983, with next to nothing to show for it, except perhaps how wasteful and foolish our defense spending can sometimes be. The following article, written by Robert Wright in the New Republic in December 1994, makes a clear case for discontinuing the high levels of treasure we spend on missile defense every year. President Clinton, who seems intent on spending far too much on defense over the next few years, must know that the new threats to our national security cannot be parried by building fanciful, expensive, uncertain missile defenses. The President and Congress instead ought to acknowledge that SDI by any name remains nothing more than a 1990’s version of the old French Maginot Line. The Maginot Line didn’t work in World War I, and star wars can’t work today, for reasons made clear over the past 10 years of congressional and public debate. Sadly, we are visiting an issue now that should have gone away in the late 1980’s. I commend the New Republic article to my colleagues, and I ask that it be printed in the RECORD. The article follows: CRAZY STATE (By Robert Wright) Gingrich argued that conservatives adopt space exploration and Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative, the so-called Star Wars program, as causes for tactical political gain. ‘‘Young people like space,’’ he said.—The Washington Post, 1985) The Strategic Defense Initiative is back. It’s right there in the Republicans’ Contract with America—or, at least, in the exegesis. The National Security Restoration Act, one of ten bills the contract would bring to a vote by spring, demands ‘‘deployment at the earliest possible date’’ of an anti-ballistic missile defense. The Republicans haven’t said whether that means a space-based defense or a land-based defense. Either way it means trashing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, upping Pentagon spending by several billion a year for research and upping it by much more when deployment starts. Why aren’t you excited? A surprisingly large number of people are. The new SDI comes with a new post-cold war rationale that has attracted not just Republicans, but some centrist Democrats. Indeed, research for a land-based SDI has stayed alive—if barely, and under another name— during the Clinton administration. Accelerated research and early deployment are thus a real political possibility, even if space- based weapons are a long shot. But before we make that leap, could somebody explain why the post-cold war rationale deserves anything less than the derision that finally overwhelmed the cold war rationale? The cold war derision had two pillars. First, there were firm doubts about technical feasibility. Nothing has since happened to undermine them. The Pentagon’s initial claim of a 96 percent success rate for the Patriot Missile against Iraqi Scuds turned out to be fantasy. Second, we realized that plain old deterrence worked just fine as a missile defense; so long as Leonid Brezhnev could count on tit for tat, he wouldn’t attack. If anything, indeed, a missile defense could weaken the perverse logic behind deterrence by making mutually assured destruction less assured; the ‘‘protected’’ nation might feel too nervy and the unprotected nation too nervous. Now, all of a sudden, we’re told that deterrence won’t work. Why? Because now we face not coolly rational, game-theoretical Soviets, but a different class of enemy: ‘‘rogue states’’—Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, Kim Jong Il’s North Korea, Muammar Qaddafi’s Libya. How does one qualify as a ‘‘rogue state’’? So far as I can tell, it helps if your leader (a) doesn’t have white skin, (b) dislikes the United States and (c) does not behave in genteel fashion (often failing, for example, to wear a necktie during affairs of state). The less polite term for ‘‘rogue state,’’ and its real meaning, is ‘‘crazy state.’’ But there is zero evidence that any of these leaders is ‘‘crazy’’ in the relevant sense: suicidal. Quite the contrary. Ronald Reagan gave Qaddafi the litmus test for sanity and he passed: we bombed his house, and he modified his behavior. Hussein has shown repeatedly that, once he knows where the brink is, he doesn’t step over it. Bear in mind that a nuclear attack on the United States would be more suicidal for these men than it would have been for the Soviets. Brezhnev might conceivably have weathered a firestorm and emerged from his bunker to inherit a world destroyed. If Saddam Hussein tried that, he would be squashed like a bug upon emerging. And he knows it. Besides, if any ‘‘crazy’’ leader does want to blow up an American city, there are SDI- proof ways: drive a bomb across the Mexican border, sail it up the Potomac on a yacht or mail it. For a seventy-pound package, second-day UPS costs less than a ballistic missile. Neo-SDI advocates also invoke fear of ‘‘accidental launch.’’ But, as John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists has written in this magazine, ‘‘Lots of things have to happen for a missile to fire. The chances of its leaping unbidden from its silo are about the same as the chances of a car starting itself up, opening the garage door and backing out into the driveway without human assistance.’’ Besides, how many missiles are aimed at America these days? Russia has agreed to point no missiles at us in exchange for our reciprocal pledge. And whether or not you trust the Russians, their own strategic logic argues increasingly for aiming elsewhere (e.g., at other former Soviet states). Similarly, North Korea’s top two targets would be South Korea and Japan. That’s the way tensions are in the post-cold war world: regionalized. The surest American defense against ‘‘accidental launch’’ is to stay on good terms with Brazil. Of course, however slight the chances of nuclear attack, and however real the chances that a missile defense would fail to repel it, a little insurance would be appealing if it were cheap enough. First of all, it isn’t cheap ($50 billion assuming meager cost overruns). Moreover, ‘‘insurance’’ conduces to solipsism; if we feel (however falsely) safe inside our little shell, waning support for internationalism will wane even faster. I’m not saying the new SDI enthusiasm is driven by nascent Republican isolationism. But the enthusiasm accommodates and nourishes the party’s isolationist strain. In the Republican summary of the Security Restoration Act, only one goal gets more prominent billing than SDI: ‘‘to ensure that U.S. troops are only deployed to support missions in the U.S.’s national security interests.’’ We all care about ‘‘national security interests.’’ But some of us think that national security (in various senses) is increasingly tied to global stability. The Republicans’ post- election rhetoric, in contrast, fixates on keeping U.S. troops out of peacekeeping roles, keeping U.S. dollars from supporting other peacekeepers and stifling the foreign aid that helps stabilize places like Russia and the Middle East. Also, of course, the Republicans don’t favor one-worldish projects like . . . well, like continued adherence to the 1972 ABM Treaty. And violating that treaty (which, alas, even the Clinton administration’s battlefield missile-defense research program threatens to do) is itself a dangerous retreat from internationalism. What’s scarier than an Indian-Pakistani border flanked by nuclear arsenals? An Indian-Pakistani border flanked by destabilizing ABMs as well. We might yet be able to head that prospect off, but not once we’ve built our own shell. The United States is now uniquely positioned to lead the world in avoiding two bad things: a global race to build destabilizing missile defense systems, and a global race to carry destabilizing weapons into space—not just anti-missile weapons, but anti-satellite weapons. The Republicans are now on record as wanting to start the first of these races, and they are clearly inclined to start the second. It’s time for President Clinton to crawl out of his bomb shelter, survey the wreckage and start fighting.∑ f PERES ON DESALINATION ∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will be reintroducing the desalination research bill, which I have introduced in two previous Congresses. It has passed the Senate twice. Unfortunately, it got caught up in the last-minute, partisan wrangling that had nothing to do with the desalination bill, and it did not pass. The need for it becomes more and more clear every day. Recently, I had the chance to read responses of Israeli Foreign Minister Simon Peres to questions at the National Press Club Forum on October 4. In response to a question by Jim Anderson of the German Press Agency, Foreign Minister Peres said: ‘‘If you want to save your children from poverty, pay attention to the water. The rivers do not follow the frontiers and the rain doesn’t go through the customs.’’ Then, in response to another question from a reporter, whose name I do VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S573 January 6, 1995 not have, he said: ‘‘There are projects that cannot be postponed.

The unfortunate reality is that desalination research has been minimal in recent years. When John F. Kennedy was President of the United States, he pushed it, but since that time, desalination research has been almost on hold. It is critical that we move ahead, and the Middle East is just one area where that is evident.∑ f BRITAIN JOINS AMERICANS IN ATTACKING TV VIOLENCE ∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are slowly but solidly making progress to reduce television entertainment violence in our country. We still have a long way to go, but I came across an Associated Press item reporting that even in Great Britain, which has much stricter standards on television violence than we do, there is concern about television violence. I thought my colleagues might be interested in the Associated Press story about violence on British television and some of the things that are happening there. I ask that the Associated Press article be printed in the RECORD at this point. The article follows: BRITAIN JOINS AMERICANS IN ATTACKING TV VIOLENCE LONDON.—British television concerned over the soaring number of violent crimes in Britain, is moving to cut down on the amount of violence and brutality shown on TV screens here. Both the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Independent Television Commission announced changes last week. The ITC told commercial TV companies to cut the amount of violence they screen and said they will be monitored to ensure they comply. Among competitor BBC’s revised guidelines for programmers: Viewers should be given more information about what programs contain before screening, so they can switch off if they wish. Programmers should have sharper awareness of portrayals of sexual violence and violence against women. U.S. programmers face a similar battle. The four U.S. broadcast networks, hoping to head off government intervention, have agreed to air parental warnings before certain shows. The BBC included no enforcement provisions in its guidelines. But as a private network, financed by license fees paid by viewers, it could simply edit out offending segments or censor entire programs. Companies who ignore the ITC guidelines can be reprimanded or fined. The commission, established by Act of Parliament, regulates Britain’s Independent Television network. David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC said in announcing ITC guidelines Thursday. ‘‘What we are seeing is a public revulsion against violence in society which is feeding through to a desire for greater sensitivity by TV programmakers and the makers of films and videos.’’ ITC guidelines tell program-makers to consider carefully in each case whether violent scenes are justified. Programmers should not look at violent scenes in isolation but consider the accumulation of such scenes on viewers. Program-makers should avoid programming which ‘‘appears to promote violence as a solution to problems or difficulties.’’ In the area of news, the guidelines note that ‘‘violent images are becoming increasingly available to news editors’’ and said TV news bulletins should take account of the time they are to be shown. The ITC guidelines say no proof exists that violence on TV encourages violent crime in real life but state: ‘‘Caution is required in the television portrayal of violence, given concern about the level of violence in society and the possibility of behavior or attitudes being influenced by what is shown on television. Broadcasters should therefore be especially vigilant about the amount of violence in their programs.’’ Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC network TV, said in announcing the BBC guidelines, ‘‘We must ensure that where violent scenes—in fictional programs or in news coverage—are felt to be editorially necessary, they are included only after careful and detailed consideration. ‘‘Although we cannot control what happens in the home, we must ensure that before material is transmitted it is tested for suitability for the time and place of its transmission—or whether it should be transmitted at all.’’∑ f IN DEFIANCE OF DARWIN ∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, no one doubts that the schools in our Nation should do better. What is still not widely known is that we really do understand how to do better, but we’re not applying the knowledge we have. Education simply has not become enough of a priority. Those of us in public life talk a good game, but too few of us do anything about it. An illustration of what can happen is an article that appeared several weeks ago in Newsweek magazine titled ‘‘In Defiance of Darwin,’’ written by Lynnell Hancock. I ask that the article be printed in the RECORD at this point. The article follows: [From Newsweek, Oct. 24, 1994] IN DEFIANCE OF DARWIN—HOW A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE BRONX TURNS DROPOUTS INTO SCHOLARS (By Lynnell Hancock) It’s a notorious corner in the South Bronx—once a grand address, now the hub of the nation’s poorest neighborhood. Today, at 149th Street and the Grand Concourse, a public high school for at-risk children defies Darwin on a daily basis. Inside Hostos-Lincoln Academy of Science, a class of seniors grapples with ‘‘The Seafarer,’’ an Old English poem about danger, survival and destiny. None of these teenagers was expected to ever navigate into the treacherous pages of medieval lit. In fact, their eight-grade counselors had written off most of them as probable dropouts, based on low reading scores and spotty attendance. That’s how they landed at Hostos. Now, after four years here, more than 80 percent are headed for college. And they engage in a lively discussion about the sailor who believes his imminent death at sea is a stark inevitability, written in foam. ‘‘The Anglo-Saxons thought every person’s fate was predetermined,’’ the teacher, Vincent Sottile, reminds the class. ‘‘But we know we have to help ourselves.’’ These 300 black and Latino students provide the basis for a strong retort to ‘‘The Bell Curve.’’ Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray argue that IQ is largely genetic and that low IQ means scant success in society. Therefore, they contend, neither effective schools nor a healthier environment can do much to alter a person’s destiny. Yet, at Hostos, reading scores nearly doubled over two years. The dropout rate is low, and attendance is high. About 70 percent of the class of 1989 graduated on time, double the city’s average. Among last year’s graduates, one was accepted at Columbia University’s School of Engineering. Others are attending Fordham University and Hamilton College. Hostos was established by the city seven years ago for South Bronx children who live ‘‘stressing lives,’’ as one student puts it, in broken families and dangerous neigh borhoods that offer only huge, anonymous public schools. Hostos is small, attentive to individual students, and demanding. To ensure that no child goes astray, one teacher is assigned for four years to the same homeroom class, which combines lessons in rudimentary social skills with those in computer and civics. Most students take honors and even college-level courses. ‘‘We threw out the Mickey Mouse curriculum and introduced [University of the State of New York] Regents-level courses,’’ said Dr. Michele Cataldi, Hostos’s founder and principal. Where students once had business math, they now have trigonometry. ‘‘At first we felt students couldn’t do it, but we were wrong,’’ says Cataldi. Teachers worked overtime to provide intensive one-on-one tutoring. The results were impressive. The number of students in each class who passed the state’s regents biology test rose from 9 to 50 percent in two years. ‘‘You have to believe in them,’’ says Donna Light-Donovan, a biology teacher. ‘‘Most kids don’t have anyone at home who does.’’ Stanley Mustafa is one student who found a haven at Hostos. A few years ago he was stabbed on the street by a neighborhood teen. His life was saved by a trauma surgeon. That’s the profession he now expects to enter some day. ‘‘It made me grow up faster,’’ says Mustafa, 17, dressed in baggy jeans and an oversize Black Sheep T shirt. ‘‘I don’t want to end up on the corner, hanging with the homeboys.’’ He takes chemistry and cellular biology at Hostos, studies radiology at a local hospital and hopes to attend Atlanta’s Morehouse School of Medicine or the University of Virginia. Nationwide, more and more districts are establishing small ‘‘restructured’’ schools like Hostos that stress team teaching, a familylike environment and high expectations. New York City has more than 35 of them, with plans for about 50 more. Herrnstein and Murray argue that 30 years of such experimental schools for disadvantaged children have shown paltry improvements, and that federal money should be funneled away from them, and toward schools for the ‘‘cognitive elite.’’ But a new study comparing 820 high schools—some big and traditional, others small and cooperative—proves otherwise. From eighth to 10th grade, students in the restructured schools showed 30 percent higher gains in math and 24 percent higher gains in reading compared with students in traditional schools.

Yet in ‘‘The Bell Curve’’ scenario, most Hostos students would give up their goals and find a valued place in society’’ back in the South Bronx. ‘‘The idea that people with the most capacity to be educated should become the most educated sounds dangerously elitist,’’ they write. In fact, at 149th and the Grand Concourse, it sounds more like ‘‘Beowulf.’’ ‘‘Fate is more strong, God more mighty than any man’s thought,’’ writes the anonymous Anglo-Saxon seafarer. And students like Mustafa know they can help themselves.∑ f DWAYNE O. ANDREAS ∑ Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I picked up the fall 1994 issue of the publication, Constitution put out twice a year by the Foundation for the U.S. Constitution in New York City. The chairman of the foundation is Dwayne O. Andreas, the chief executive officer of Archer Daniels Midland [ADM] and a public-spirited citizen who has been willing to come to the fore on many key national concerns. I opened the magazine to read a preamble by Dwayne Andreas, and it is so loaded with common sense that I ask that it be inserted into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at the end of my remarks. Democracy can prevail only if citizens exercise self-restraint. We cannot see how close to the edge of the cliff we can come in exercising our freedoms. What Dwayne Andreas calls civic responsibility is the obligation of those of us in public office and of all American citizens. An item he refers to later in the publication is good but is, frankly, not as pointed as the Dwayne Andreas comment. I urge my colleagues and their staffs to read Dwayne Andreas’s comments, which follows. At this point, I ask that Mr. Andreas’s statement be printed in the RECORD. The statement follows: The rights we enjoy as American citizens have been a central focus of Constitution since we began publishing the magazine in 1988. In this issue we present a Special Report in which we consider the other side of the contract: the obligations of citizens to their society. These days, I sometimes wonder whether there is a contract—whether we Americans recognize any limits on our freedom to do as we please. We seem to have forgotten that the Constitution guarantees our rights within society. Increasingly, individuals and groups manifest a kind of ‘‘in your face’’ contempt for the rights of their fellow citizens; social obligations take a back seat to personal fulfillment and economic gain. Nowhere is this lack of civility more evident than in the area of social expression protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Brutality, obscenity and raw sex have become the common coin of television, film and popular music; all who question the fitness of these materials for a generally youthful audience are derided as prudes or thought controllers. And the purveyors of this destructive effluvium assert their right to sell it; few dare to speak of society’s right to resist the tide. But society does have that right, and I fear that those who abuse the First Amendment in this way may be endangering the splendid guarantee that has protected them for so long. Even sober commentators like Irving Kristol worry about whether the First Amendment can survive. Writing for the wall Street Journal not long ago, Kristol labeled television violence a form of child abuse and suggested that ‘‘modest limits on adult liberties ought to be perfectly acceptable if they prevent tens of thousands of children from growing up into criminal adults.’’ Are such legislated limits truly necessary? I don’t think so. Rather what’s required is recalling that there is such a thing as civic responsibility—that with the rights of citizenship go some obligations. To remind readers of these obligations, we have prepared the Special Report that begins on page 50. These pages carry a timely reminder. Ignoring it could menace the guarantees about which this magazine has written so much since it was founded six years ago.∑ f SENATORS DOLE AND DASCHLE Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we all know, the 104th Congress convened Wednesday and before we become too immersed in the legislative process, I want to take a moment to recognize the two leaders who will guide us through the next 2 years. It has been my experience that some of the key qualities of a good leader are decisiveness, ability, commitment, integrity, and moral and physical courage. The new majority leader, Senator ROBERT DOLE, posses those attributes and many more, and I am proud to call him my friend. BOB’S commitment to public service began in 1943 when he raised his right hand and enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II raged at its height. A natural leader, young G.I. DOLE soon earned a commission and found himself commanding a platoon in the famed 10th Mountain Division, which remains one of the Army’s premiere combat units. During bloody and vicious fighting against the Germans in the rugged terrain of Italy, BOB was severely wounded twice and very nearly lost his life. Though decorated for his valorous acts in battle, Senator DOLE carries with him to this day a very noticeable reminder of the cost of liberty and of warfare. I am sure that each of use recognizes the disability that BOB has overcome as a reminder that war, or the employment of military force, is not a matter to be considered lightly, and that whenever young Americans are placed in harm’s way, they run the risk of being killed, wounded, or maimed. In 1951 BOB was elected to the Kansas State legislature, beginning a career that ultimately brought him to this Chamber. His time in the statehouse was quickly followed by a term as county attorney and then four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1968, BOB came to the U.S. Senate and it was immediately apparent to me that he was a man destined to go places. In the ensuring 27 years, I have been pleased and proud to watch BOB’S career progress, as he served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee; as he was overwhelmingly reelected to the Senate four times; to watch him climb the Senate leadership ladder to the position he now holds; and, to see him nominated for the Vice Presidency of the United States in 1976. I have no doubt that the unbeatable combination of Senator DOLE’S drive and experience, along with what just might be a strong streak of destiny, may lead him to the White House before his career in public service comes to an end. Senator DOLE has been leader of the Senate Republicans when we have been both the majority and minority party in this body and he has distinguished himself well in both roles. While not everyone may agree with Senator DOLE’S politics, they do respect the manner in which he conducts himself and the business of the Senate. Now that our party has once again regained control of this body, I know that Senator DOLE will work closely with Members on the other side of the aisle to ensure that they are treated fairly, and that the 104th Congress will be marked as a period of progress, accomplishment, and bipartisanship. BOB DOLE is a man I hold in high esteem and whose find friendship I value greatly. As anyone of us who stood on this side of the aisle for the last 8 years can tell you, being in the minority can be a frustrating experience. With an effective leader, though, the minority party can play an important role in the legislative process, not only contributing to the debate, but strengthening bills passed by Congress. The man whom the Democrats have elected as their leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE of South Dakota, is a person who I believe will be an effective voice for Senate Democrats. TOM is no stranger to public service, as he spent time as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force, as a valued aide to a South Dakota State senator, and four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he held several leadership positions. Although TOM was just recently elected to the position of Democratic leader, he has been a distinguished member of this body for the past 9 years. During his tenure, Senator DASCHLE has demonstrated himself to be an able and effective legislator, working hard for his constituency in South Dakota. I have had the pleasure of serving with TOM on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and have found him to be a serious minded man and one of purpose. It was of little surprise to me that TOM rose to the important post he now holds. I have every confidence that he will be an effective leader for our Democratic VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S575 January 6, 1995 colleagues and I am equally confident that he will work well with the Republican majority. While many may believe that politics in the United States is based on an adversarial relationship between parties, each of us knows that it is a system which encourages and fosters compromise—that to actually legislate, we must seek common ground. Senators DOLE and DASCHLE are two men who are committed to ensuring that this body functions efficiently and effectively by seeking that point where Members can vote to pass a bill. I congratulate BOB and TOM on winning their leadership elections, and I look forward to working with both of them throughout the duration of the 104th Congress. f WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS SAID YES Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. Constitution knows that no President can spend a dime of Federal tax money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by Congress—both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. So when you hear a politician or an editor or a commentator declare that ‘‘Reagan ran up the Federal debt’’ or that ‘‘Bush ran it up,’’ bear in mind that it was, and is, the constitutional duty and responsibility of Congress to control Federal spending. Congress has failed miserably in that task for about 50 years. The fiscal irresponsibility of Congress has created a Federal debt which stood at $4,805,835,231,225.14 as of the close of business Thursday, January 5. Averaged out, every man, woman, and child in America owes a share of this massive debt, and that per capita share is $18,243.03. f IN MEMORY OF SHERRY STETSON MANNIX Mr. WARNER. Mr President, on Tuesday of this week, Sherry Stetson Mannix died after a long and valiant battle with cancer. Mrs. Mannix’s title was Foreign Affairs Specialist in the Bureau of Multilateral Affairs of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. But that does not begin to describe her fine work or her life-long dedication to her country. Mrs. Mannix served for 11 years as an officer in the U.S Air Force and then for another 9 years in the Air Force Reserve, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. She joined the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1984 and became the Agency’s premier expert on the Chemical Weapons Convention, which she helped to negotiate. Both before and after the CWC was negotiated, Mrs. Mannix was the principal persons to whom we and others turned when questions arose on how that very complicated convention would work. During its consideration of the CWC last year, the Select Committee on In telligence, of which I was then vice chairman, submitted to the executive branch over 130 questions for the record regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was Sherry Mannix who answered many of those questions and edited the others, even though she was already in tremendous physical pain due to the illness that she knew would soon take her life. Those answers were so well-written and informative that we actually published 64 of them, as an appendix to our committee’s public report, ‘‘U.S. Capability to Monitor Compliance With the Chemical Weapons Convention.’’ Only rarely do we find such executive branch answers so worthy of publishing, and only very rarely does any human being demonstrate the devotion to duty and country that Mrs. Mannix did throughout the last year. Sherry Mannix was only 44 when she died. If life were fair, we would have enjoyed her company and her service for many more years. Instead, we today offer our deep condolence to her husband, retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charles R. Mannix, and to her mother, Albertie Stetson, both of whom reside in my State, as well as to her grandmother, Bernal B. Allen. And in remembering Sherry Mannix we say, Thank you for a job well done and a life well lived, right to the very end. f COMMENDING CHIEF ROBERT STEWART Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, South Carolina is probably the most idyllic place anyone might consider living. The pace of life there is relaxed, the people are friendly, and the weather is temperate. Unfortunately, even a State as peaceful as mine is not free from the evils and dangers of crime. Leading the fight against illegal activity in the Palmetto State is an organization created by me when I served as Governor of South Carolina, the State Law Enforcement Division, commonly referred to as ‘‘SLED.’’ At the helm of SLED is a man whom I have had the pleasure of knowing for many years, Chief Robert M. Stewart, and whom I am pleased to call a friend. The chief has literally dedicated his life to police work and has gained national recognition as an aggressive officer and a true professional. Chief Stewart, a native of Cheraw, began his career as a teenager when he signed on as a cadet with his hometown police department and worked his way up the leadership ladder, earning the position of director of public safety before he had even turned 30. In 1975, he stepped down as director and joined SLED as a special agent. In the following 20 years, his career advanced rapidly while he worked on cases ranging from those that were routine and mundane to ones that were international in scope. A veteran of the SWAT team, Robert specialized in white collar and public corruption cases, and worked closely with Federal agencies investigating such crimes in South Carolina. In 1988, Gov. Carroll Campbell appointed Robert as the chief of SLED, where he has done an unparalleled job of administering the agency. When he took over SLED, Chief Stewart’s goal was to make it an organization that was recognized as being one of the most professional, progressive, and modern law enforcement agencies in the United States. Over the past 7 years he has done just that. By regionalizing the agency, and streamlining its rank structure, Chief Stewart has ensured that his agents are better able to monitor and address crime trends throughout the State. Additionally, Chief Stewart secured a brand- new lab, that is not only used by SLED, but is available to any other police department in the State of South Carolina. Thanks to the chief’s commitment and vision, last year SLED became only the second State investigative agency in the Nation to receive professional accreditation by the Committee on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies. Mr. President, Chief Stewart celebrates his 50th birthday today, and I want to take this opportunity to recognize and commend him for dedicating more than half his life to protecting the people and property of South Carolina. Chief Stewart is a man of great ability, integrity, and courage, and I am proud of his many accomplishments. I wish him good health and happiness in the years ahead, and look forward to continuing to hear great things about him. f UNITED STATES ARMS EMBARGO ON BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 2 days ago I introduced legislation together with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, to terminate the United States arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina as of May 1, 1995. As I mentioned in my remarks at the that time, I believed that this legislation was not only consistent with international law in upholding Bosnia’s inherent right to self-defense, but that it would also serve to provide some badly needed leverage for the Bosnians on the diplomatic side. I understand that today, Adm. Leighton Smith, commander of NATO Forces in Southern Europe told reporters that he opposed this legislation. I am not surprised that a four-star admiral would not oppose his Commander in Chief, nor that a NATO commander would not choose to contradict the NATO-Secretary General. I would note, however, that in addition to candidate Bill Clinton, the following former high-level Government officials, including Cabinet members, have publicly supported lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia: Zbigniew Brzezinski; Frank Carlucci; George VerDate Aug 31 2005 05:28 May 25, 2008 Jkt 041999 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\\\\ODA15\\\\1995_F~1\\\\S06JA5.REC S06JA5m m ah er o n M IK E T E M P w ith S O C IA L S E C U R IT Y N U M B E R S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES576 January 6, 1995 Shultz; Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Wolfowitz; Richard Perle; and Max Kampelman—quite an impressive list. Moreover, I would emphasize that the late Manfred Woerner, the previous Secretary General, advocated helping the victims of aggression, especially when the international community does not have the resolve to take action on behalf of that victim. That is surely the case in Bosnia. It seems to me however, that the views that should be given the most weight, are those of the Bosnians. It is their country and their future we are talking about. And so, I would like to share two letters with my colleagues which I received from the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, and from the Bosnian Ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Sacirbey. Both letters strongly support the Dole/Lieberman bill. First I would like to quote from President Izetbegovic’s letter to me: The leadership of the United States of America is essential in the search for peace in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The legislation that you and Senator Lieberman have offered is entirely supportive of peace efforts and the continuing leadership of your country in this matter. We wholeheartedly concur that the arms embargo should be terminated ‘‘de facto’’ no later than May 1, 1995. By such date the preliminary agreement on the cessation of hostilities would have expired and by then the Serbians would have opted to accept the contract group peace plan or to continue the war. We believe that this legislation would be most pivotal not only in confronting international aggression and acts of genocide against our Republic, but also in encouraging the Serbians to opt for peace. The letter from Ambassador Sacirbey states the following, and I quote, We wish to reiterate our full support for congressional efforts, in particular S. 21, to terminate the application of the U.S. arms embargo on the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina * * * The elements of your proposed legislation are in complete convergence with our views. We are also of the opinion that this legislation is entirely consistent with the search for peace in our country * * * We need to keep things in perspective. The strains within NATO have not been caused by congressional efforts to lift the embargo, but the present policy itself. The credibility of the alliance has been damaged because NATO has allowed itself to become a subcontractor to the United Nations. The only way to reverse this situation is for the United States to reassert its leadership in support of a better policy. The Clinton administration was on the right track in May 1993, it is now time to get back on that track. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred to be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, PERMANENT MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS, New York, January 4, 1995. Hon. ROBERT DOLE, Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR MAJORITY LEADER: We wish to reiterate our full support for Congressional efforts, in particular S. 21, to terminate the application of the U.S. arms embargo on the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must also express our sincere appreciation for these efforts and our admiration for the thoughtful manner by which this matter has been guided by you. The elements of your proposed legislation are in complete convergence with our views. We also are of the opinion that this legislation is entirely consistent with the search for peace in our country and the congressional intent established during the debate on this issue during the previous Congressional session. The United States delegation to the United Nations, under the capable and faithful direction of Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright, had ‘‘tabled’’ a draft resolution within the Security Council to lift the arms embargo on our Government. Unfortunately, this resolution met resistance from some key nations in the Council, although it has never been put to a vote. In fact, our efforts to facilitate a consensus on this matter through flexibility were misconstrued and have not met with a positive response. We believe that U.S. leadership in bringing an end to this unjust arms embargo continues to be an essential element in ending this international aggression and acts of genocide against my country. Once again, thank you for your leadership regarding this matter. Sincerely, MUHAMED SACIRBEY, Ambassador and Permanent Representative. REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENCY, January 5, 1995. Hon. ROBERT DOLE, Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
